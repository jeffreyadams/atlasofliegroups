<p>
The aim of this package is to provide tools for the exploration by computer
of the combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of the representation theory of
reductive Lie groups (for the time being, <i>real</i> reductive Lie groups;
see <a href="scope.html">here</a> for a precise description of the class of 
groups under consideration.) The current (and very preliminary) version is
0.2.2 <a href="download.html">(download)</a>
</p>

<p>
For the time being, the package is provided with the 
<a href="interface.html">command line interface</a>
that is used during its development. The intention is to ultimately release
it in the form of a set of libraries, with hopefully a number of interfaces
to high-level systems such as Maple, Mathematica or GAP.
</p>

<p>
The main capabilities of the program are the following :
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="structure.html">Structure theory;</a>
</li>
<li><a href="gKmod.html">(<b>g</b>,K)-modules;</a></li>
<li>(... more to follow ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>

<a href= "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html"><em>copyleft</em></a>
license of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html"> Free Software
Foundation</a>; therefore it is not in the public domain, but may be
freely copied, distributed, modified, and incorporated into other software,
provided only that the modified versions be clearly identified as such, and
that programs incorporating all or part of this code be in turn distributed
