Given a block for a real group, the "dualblock" command constructs a
block for a real form of the dual group which is dual in the sense of
Vogan to the given block.

Fix a block B of representations of a real form G(R) of G, with
regular integral infinitesimal character. (This is a finite set of
irreducible representations; the the help file for the block
command). According to Vogan {IC4] there is a real form G^v(R) of the
dual group G^v, and a block B^v of representations of G^v(R) with
regular integral infinitesimal character, which is "dual" to B. This
means that there is a bijection B -> B^v, written pi -> pi^v, with a
number of properties.

In the context of Atlas a block B is determined by a real form of G
and a real form of G^v. Associated to these choices are K and K^v, the
(complexified) maximal compact subgroups of the real form of G and
G^v, respectively. The K-orbits on G/B are parametrized by integers
0<=x<=m, and those of K^v on G^v/B^v by integers 0<=y<=n. The B is
parametrized by a subset S of pairs (x,y). See the help file for the
block command. The numbering of the kgb elements for G^v is that of
the dualkgb command.

The dual block B^v is parametrized by {(y,x)| (x,y) in S}.

The dualmap command gives the bijection between B and B^v. Also see
dualkgb.


Example: principal block for Sp(4,R) and its dual

The principal block of Sp(4,R) (containing a finite dimensional
representation) has 12 elements. The corresponding real form of the
dual group is the split one, SO(4,3). There are 11 orbits (0..10) of K
on G/B, and 7 (0..6) of K^v on G^v/B^v.

The block B contains 4 discrete series representations, numbers 0-4,
with parameters (0,6),(1,6),(2,6) and (3,6). Dual to these are 4
principal series representations of SO(4,3), numbers 8-11, with
parameters (6,0),(6,1), (6,2) and (6,3).

Example: Block of the irreducible principal series of Sp(4,R)

Take G(R)=Sp(4,R) and G^v(R)=SO(5) (compact). Then K\G/B has 11
elements as in the previous example, and K^v\G^v/B^v is a
singleton. In this case the block B consists of a single irreducible
principal series representation of Sp(4,R), parametrized by
(10,0). The dual block consists of the trivial representation of
SO(5), parametrized by (0,10).
