The "block" command prints out a list of representations in a single block.
A block is an equivalence class of irreducible representations, where the
equivalence relation is generated by the relation of two representations
having a non-split extension. At present we can consider only blocks of
representations having regular integral infinitesimal character.

The user must specify a (real form defining a) real group and a dual real form
(a real form of the dual complex group); unless these were already specified
before or only one choice is available, the program will prompt for a
selection. These data determine a block (up to the equivalences of categories
provided by the Jantzen-Zuckerman translation principle). For a given real
group $G$, the largest and most interesting block is the one containing a
finite-dimensional representation of $G$; it is selected by choosing in the
dual group the quasisplit real form (always the last choice provided).

Each row of the output corresponds to a single irreducible representation in
the block. The output may be saved to a file, or viewed on the terminal.

The first column is a numbering of the elements, from 0 to $n-1$ (with $n$ the
number of elements in the block), each followed by a pair $(x,y)$. Here $x$ is
the number of an orbit of $K$ on $G/B$, as enumerated by the 'kgb' command.
Similarly $y$ is the number of an orbit of $K^\vee$ on $G^\vee/B^\vee$, as
enumerated by the 'kgb' command for the dual group and the chosen dual real
form (or more simply by the 'dualkgb' command). The pair $(x,y)$ is a
parameter for a representation of $G$ (so the negative transpose of the
involution of $H$ associated to $x$ is the one of $H^\vee$ associated to $y$.)

The next column gives the length of the parameter $(x,y)$.

Then comes, in brackets, a sequence giving the types of all simple roots:

i1: imaginary, non-compact, type 1 (single valued Cayley transform)
i2: imaginary, non-compact, type 2 (double valued Cayley transform)
ic: imaginary compact (no Cayley or inverse Cayley transforms)
r1: real, type 1 (double valued inverse Cayley transform)
r2: real, type 2 (single valued inverse Cayley transform)
rn: real, non-parity (no inverse Cayley or Cayley transforms)
C+: complex, cross action increases length
C-: complex, cross action decreases length

Type 1 real and imaginary roots correspond to a subgroup $SL(2,\R)$.
The imaginary Cayley transforms are single valued, and the inverse real
Cayley transforms are double valued. Type 2 real and imaginary roots
correspond to a subgroup $PGL(2,\R)$, in which the situation is reversed.

A slightly different formulation of these explanations may be found in
the help file for the blocku command.

The next sequence of $r$ columns (where $r$ is the number of simple roots)
gives the cross actions of the simple roots: number $s$ of the sequence gives
the number of the parameter to which the current parameter is sent under the
cross action by simple root $s$.

The next $r$ columns give Cayley transform(s) or inverse Cayley transform(s)
of the current parameter by the respective simple root, if any are defined. In
case of a non-compact imaginary root there are one or two Cayley transforms,
and in the case of real type 1 or 2 root there are two or one inverse Cayley
transforms, and in other cases none are defined. The format used is $(k,k')$
where $k$ and $k'$ are either the number of a parameter reached from the
current parameter by the Cayley transform or inverse Cayley transform, or '*'
if at that position no such transform is defined.

The next column gives the number of the Cartan class determined by the
above-mentioned involution $x$ of $H$ (the numbering matches the one
produced by the 'cartan' command).

The final column gives the twisted involution of the Weyl group that specifies
the involution of $H$ (see the help for the 'kgb' command).
