The "klwrite" command generates two binary files encoding the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for a block: essentially what is output in
human-readable form by the "klbasis" command.  These files are needed
as input for some other commands, including "extract-cells" and
"extract-graph."  They are translated interactively to human-readable
form by the KLread utility (source code in
sources/interpreter/KLread.cpp).

The first file "matrix output" contains indexing data for the
polynomials: which polynomial number is attached to which pair of
block elements.  The user is asked to choose a name for it; something
like

     sl6R-mat

might be convenient if the real group in question is SL(6,R), but the
choice is entirely up to the user.  The output can be placed in
another directory by specifying something like

     ../../atlasoutput/sl6r-mat

The second file "coefficient output" contains a list of the (distinct)
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the block.  (This is more or less what
is produced in human-readable form by the "kllist" command, although
here the polynomials are ordered by the order in which they were
computed.) The user is asked to choose a name for it; something
like

     sl6R-coef

might be convenient.
