The "klbasis" command prints out the list of all the non-zero
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials in the block. These are polynomials
P_{\gamma,\nu} with \gamma,\nu in the block. Necessarily
length(\gamma)<=length(\nu) (in fact gamma<=\nu in the Bruhat order). 
Here \gamma,\nu are represented by numbers 0,...,n-1 from the output
of the block command. 

The polynomials have the following meaning. Associated to each block B
is a family of regular integral infinitesimal characters. For any such
infinitesimal character lambda the block corresponds to a set of
irreducible representations with infinitesimal character lambda. See
the help file for the block command.

Fix a block B and a a regular infinitesimal character for B.  Then
associated to each block element 0<=x<=n is a standard module I(x),
with unique irreducible quotient J(x). The Grothendieck group of B
consists of formal sums \sum_x a_x J(x) with each a_x an integer. This
Z-module is also spanned by the standard modules I(x). In other words
there is an identity in the Grothendieck group

J(y)=sum_x M(x,y)I(x) 

where the sum is over the block (only x<=y in the Bruhat order
contribute), and the M(x,y) are integers. These are given by the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials P_{x,y} evaluated at q=1:

M(x,y)=(-1)^{length(x)-length(y)}P_{x,y}(1).

The output of klbasis is of the form:

 y:   x1: P_{x1,y}
      x2: P_{x2,y}
      x3: P_{x3,y}
      ...

For example

 8:  0: 1
     1: 1
     2: 1
     4: 1
     6: 1
     8: 1

means 

P_{0,8}=P_{1,8}=P_{2,8}=P_{4,8}=P_{6,8}=P_{8,8}=1

and all other P_{x,8}=0.

The final information is the number of non-zero polynomials, the
number of polynomials P_{x,y}=0 even though where x<=y in the Bruhat
order, and the number of pairs (x,y) with x<=y in the Bruhat order.

Example: the block of the trivial representation of SL(2,R):

block:
0(0,1):  0  0  [i1]  1   (2,*)
1(1,1):  0  0  [i1]  0   (2,*)
2(2,0):  1  1  [r1]  2   (0,1)   1

I(0)=J(0)=pi_+=holomorphic discrete series, length=0
I(1)=J(1)=pi_-=anti-holomorphic discrete series, length=0
I(0)=spherical principal series, J(0)=C=trivial representation, length=1

klbasis:
Full list of non-zero Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials:

0: 0: 1

1: 1: 1

2: 0: 1
   1: 1
   2: 1

The last three lines tell us:

P_{0,2)=P_{1,2}=P_{2,2}=1

which with the length information gives:

M(0,2)=-1
M(1,2)=-1
M(2,2)=1

i.e.

J(2)=-I(0)-I(1)+I(2)

or in more familiar terms an identity in the Grothendieck group:

C= (spherical principal series) - pi_+ - pi_-

This is an inversion of the familiar decomposition of the spherical
principal series into irreducible Jordan Holder factors:

spherical principal series = pi_+ + pi_- + C

Example: Sp(4,R)

Here is part of the output of klbasis for the block of the trivial
representation of Sp(4,R):

10:  0: 1
     1: 1
     2: 1
     3: 1
     4: 1
     5: 1
     6: 1
     7: 1
     8: 1
     9: 1
    10: 1

J(10) is the trivial representation C, and we conclude

C=I(10)-I(9)-I(8)-I(7)+I(6)+I(5)+I(4)-I(3)-I(2)-I(1)-I(0)
