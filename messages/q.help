The command "q" is used to exit the current mode (such as help mode),
and fall back to the previous mode. This forgets any mode-specific
information (such as the real form for real mode) and any associated data
that may have been computed using it. In empty mode, "q" does nothing.

To exit the program you need to type "qq" (in any mode except help mode).
