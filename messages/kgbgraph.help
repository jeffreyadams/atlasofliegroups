The "kgbgraph" command produces a 'dot' file containing the
(codimension one) cross actions, Cayley transforms, and
closure relations for the orbits of K on the flag variety G/B.
This file can be processed by the free graph visualization
program 'dot' available from

http://www.graphviz.org.

Use the commands 'kgb' and 'kgborder' to view this information
in plain text form.

The software will prompt the user for a real form if it has not
already been chosen, after which the user is prompted to enter
an output file. Generally this should be the name of an ASCII
text file ending in '.dot'. If no file name is entered, the
command is aborted.

For example:
empty: type
Lie type: B2 sc s
main: realform
(weak) real forms are:
0: so(5)
1: so(4,1)
2: so(3,2)
enter your choice: 2
real: kgbgraph
kgbsize: 11
Name an output file (return for stdout, ? to abandon): spin32.dot

Here the quasi-split form of type B2 is chosen with an output file
name of 'spin32.dot'. To convert this to a visual graph (assuming
'dot' is intsalled on the local system and in the users path) exit
Fokko and type:

dot -Tps -ospin32.dot spin32.ps

This will create a '.ps' file named 'spin32.ps' containing a picture
of the closure poset. Attempting to generate pictures from extremely
large posets is not recommended.

In the graph there is one vertex for each element of K\G/B labelled
according to the output of the 'kgb' command. An edge appears
connecting vi to vj (i > j) if orbit j is an immediate predecessor
to orbit i in the closure poset. Moreover, edges are colored as follows:

Complex (i.e. codimension one) cross action: black edge
Cayley transform of type I: blue edge
Cayley transform of type II: green edge
Additional closure edges not from above: light gray
