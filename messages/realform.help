The "realform" command sets or resets the current real form. This
interaction is also automatically initiated when you enter a command
that requires a real form, but no real form is currently set. The only
real forms that are allowed are those from the current inner class, that
was chosen when the complex group was set (see the help for "type".)

Let G be the current complex group. This program deals with two types
of real forms of G: strong and weak ones. A weak real form is just a
G-conjugacy class of involutions of G; this is stronger than the
natural concept of isomorphism for real reductive groups, which would
amount to taking Aut(G)-conjugacy classes of involutions. Actually,
the only (quasi)-simple groups for which there is a difference are of
type D_n with n even: then there are two weak real forms whose Lie
algebra is so*(n) (for n = 4, there are even three; and for n = 4
there is also a non-trivial action of Out(G) on inner classes, which
we may harmlessly ignore, as explained in the help for "type".) For
general semisimple groups, on the other hand, there are _lots_ of
isomorphic weak real forms: think of (A_1)^n, which has 2^n weak real
forms, but only n+1 non-isomorphic ones. Strong real forms are certain
liftings of weak real forms that need not concern us here.

For fixed G, a real form is entirely described by the corresponding real
form of the Lie algebra of G. It turns out that the classification of real
forms can be nicely computed from the root datum and the inner class. So
this is what the program does: it computes the possibilities, and lists
them in an order of decreasing compactness, letting the user choose.

The real forms are output in a form consistent with the way the Lie type
was input, with the usual symbols for the classical groups. For example,
if your Lie type was A2.B3.C4, with inner class ccc, you get 32 possible
real forms, one of which might be su(2,1).so(5,2).sp(3,1); the first one
in the list is the fundamental (most compact) real form, in this case
the compact form su(3).so(7).sp(4); the last one is the quasi-split
form, in this case su(2,1).so(4,3).sp(8,R). Note that although types B2
and C2 are equivalent, giving isomorphic groups and identical results up
to a different numbering of the simple reflections, the naming of their
real forms follows the 'B' or 'C' style chosen by the user, so the real
form that is called 'so(4,1)' for type B2 is called 'sp(1,1)' for C2.

For the simple exceptional Lie algebras, intermediate real forms are
described in terms of their maximal compact subalgebra. For instance,
the three real forms of the Lie algebra of type E8 are e8 (our notation
for the compact form), e8(e7.su(2)), and e8(R) (our notation for the
split form.)

NOTE ON TYPE D: as noted above, the Lie algebra of type D_n, n even > 2,
has two weak real forms isomorphic to so*(2n), which it is important to
distinguish. This can be done as follows. Let [1,0] be one of the
off-diagonal central elements in Spin(2n), and D = {e,[1,0]} the
two-element subgroup it generates; let G = Spin(2n)/D. Then the group of
real points of G for one of the two so*(2n)'s is connected, and not for
the other. And of course when we use the element [0,1] instead the
situation is reversed. We denote so*(2n)[1,0] the real form for which
the real points of G are _not_ connected, and so*(2n)[0,1] the other
one.

In type D4, there are actually three isomorphic real forms, which, bowing to
tradition, we denote unsymmetrically as so*(8)[1,0], so*(8)[0,1] and so(6,2).
To be consistent with the above convention, so(6,2) should have been denoted
so*(8)[1,1]. Then it is still true that the real form of G = Spin(8)/{e,z}
corresponding to so*(8)[z] is disconnected (and isomorphic to SO(6,2)), the
two other ones connected (and isomorphic to SO*(8).)
