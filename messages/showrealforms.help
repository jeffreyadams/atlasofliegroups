The "showrealforms" command prints out the list of all the weak real forms
for the current complex group. Real forms are labelled by their corresponding
Lie algebras, since for a fixed complex group the real form of the Lie algebra
determines the real form of the group. The real forms are ordered (roughly)
by "increasing splitness". The numbering is used consistently in all i/o 
operations.
