The "dualkgb" command computes the same output as the kgb command, but
for a real form of the dual group. The user can thus compute kgb for
the dual group without having to reset the current complex group. 

The dualblock and dualmap commands use the numbering of kgb elements
for the dual group provided by dualkgb. 

NB: the numbering of kgb elements provided by the dualkgb command and
the kgb command (applied with the dual group in place of G) may fail
to agree.
