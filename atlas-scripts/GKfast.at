{ The existing code for GK_dimension@Param does a lot of calculation in
the character table for G to get a nilpotent for G; but the desired
GK dimension was known from the calculation down in the integral
root datum. So this version cuts to the chase. Should be noticeably
faster for large G and nonintegral infinitesimal character. Should be
incorporated into associated_variety_annihilator.at }

set GKfast (Param p) = int:
   let cell=W_cell_of(Finalize(p))
   then ct_L=cell.root_datum.character_table
in #posroots(p.root_datum) -
   ct_L.degree(ct_L.special_character_inefficient(cell))
