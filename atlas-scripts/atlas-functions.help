error: (*,...->*) : print values and abort computation; report a runtime error

to_string:(*,...->string): string representation of arguments (concatenated)
print: (T->T): print value, followed by newline; return same value
prints: (*,...->): print values raw (no quotes or commas) followed by newline
ascii: (string->int): ASCII code of initial character, or -1 if string empty
ascii: (int->string): string of length 1 with given ASCII code (if safe value)

null: (int->vec): null vector of given length
null: (int,int->mat): null matrix with given number of rows and columns
id_mat: (int->mat): identity matrix of given size.
diagonal: (vec->mat): square diagonal matrix with given diagonal entries.
shape : (mat->int,int) : dimensions (rows,columns) of a matrix

swiss_matrix_knife: (int,mat,int,int,int,int->mat): slice and dice a matrix
  This function selects a block from a matrix, and depending on the options in
  its first argument can apply a number of transformations on the fly. The
  basic call swiss_matrix_knife(0,A,i,k,j,l) returns the block A[i:k,j:l] (and
  is in fact used behind the scenes to implement that syntax). The first
  (integer) argument specifies 8 options (its value is taken modulo 2^8=256)
  as follows. Bits 0,1,2 modify row indexing: setting bit 0 reverses the rows
  before selecting, and bits 1,2 when set specify that i respectively k count
  from the end (they are subtracted from the number of rows before being
  used). Similarly bits 3,4,5 modify column indexing. Bit 6 when set specifies
  that the resulting block is transposed, and bit 7 when set indicates that
  all entries of the resulting matrix are negated (they are multiplied by -1).

echelon: (mat->mat,mat,[int],int): column echelon form, with extra information
  This applies to the n*m matrix A column operations and possibly removal of
  null columns to obtain an n*k matrix M (with k<=m) and an invertible matrix
  C that records the column operations performed; an increasing sequence s of
  k "pivot rows" and the a sign eps equal to the determinant of C are also
  recorded for convenience: the qudruple (M,C,s,eps) is returned. Here C is the
  result of applying to an m*m matrix initialized as identity the same column
  operations that were a applied to A, except that column removal is replaced
  in C by moving the column to the right end; as a consequence A*C equals M
  extended by m-k zero columns (so the last m-k columns of C are a basis of
  the kernel of A). For each j with 0<=j<k one the entries M[s[j],j] is
  nonzero (the pivot entry) and M[i,j]=0 for i>s[j].
diagonalize: (mat->vec,mat,mat): partial Smith reduction, without divisibility
  Applies row and column operations to the matrix to obtain diagonal form;
  returns the list of non-zero diagonal entries (all except the first are
  assured to be positive), and the pair of determinant 1 integral matrices
  that have been applied to left and right respectively.
adapted_basis: (mat->mat,vec): find basis whose integer multiples span image
  Returns for an n*m matrix M a pair (B,c) of an invertible n*n matrix B (so
  its columns form a basis of Z^n) and matching list c of k<=m positive
  integers, such that the multiples c_j*B_j of the first k columns of B
  span the image lattice of M (the lattice spanned by the columns of M).

kernel: (mat->mat): find matrix whose columns span kernel of the given matrix
eigen_lattice: (mat,int->mat): eigen-lattice of matrix (at integer eigenvalue)
  eigen_lattice(M,lambda) = kernel(M-lambda*id_mat(n)), where #M=(n,n)
row_saturate: (mat->mat): keep same kernel, but row-span saturated sublattice
  Interpreting rows of the matrix as linear forms, this transforms the system
  into an equivalent one, and whose Z-linear map is made to be surjective.
  In other words, the rows are made linearly independent, and the sublattice
  they generate saturated: if an integer multiple of v is in it, then so is v.

inv_fact: (mat->vec): invariant factors in Smith normal form (no zeros).
Smith_basis: (mat->mat): a basis on which the Smith normal form is assumed.
Smith: (mat->mat,vec): Smith(M)= ( Smith_basis(M), inv_fact(M) ) (almost).
  Smith(M) describes explicitly the sublattice spanned by the columns of M.
  The first component is an invertible matrix, whose columns, multiplied by
  the corresponding entries of the second component, span that sublattice.
  inv_fact(M) is the list of the invariant factors of M, which are like the
  second component of adapted_basis(M), but with additional requirement that
  each entry divides the next; this may involve using a different basis.
  Smith_basis(M) is that basis corresponding to inv_fact(M), an invertible
  (over Z) square matrix equal in height to M, whose columns, each multiplied
  by the corresponding invariant factor (or 0), span the same as those of M

invert: (mat->mat,int): invert(M)=inv,d such that M*inv=d*Id, with d minimal.
  The inverse matrix, represented as an integral numerator matrix inv, and a
  minimal positive common denominator d. Note: d does not mean determinant.
mod2_section (mat->mat): find section (left/right/inverse) of binary matrix
  The argument is reduced modulo 2 to a matrix A over Z/2Z; it returns a
  matrix B such that ABA=A and BAB=B; it will be an inverse/left inverse/right
  inverse of (over Z/2Z) whenever A is bijective/surjective/injective.

subspace_normal: (mat->mat,mat,mat,[int]) normalized modulo-2 basis
  Given a sequence of binary vectors, namely the reduction modulo 2 of the
  columns of the argument matrix, find a normalized basis for the subspace
  they span (a matrix in reduced column echelon form without zero columns),
  and also expressions for the basis vectors in terms of the given list, a
  basis for the relations between the vectors, and a list of pivot values
  (each list given as a matrix with the specified vectors as its columns).
  The argument is a list of n generators of size r whose components are
  interpreted modulo 2, the first output component is a reduced echelon basis,
  consisting of d binary vectors of size r where d is the dimension of the
  subspace, the next component has d binary vectors of size n, giving the
  combination of generators that produced this basis vector, the next
  component has n-d binary vectors of size n, each giving basis of the linear
  dependency relations among the generators, and the final component is an
  increasing sequence of non-negative d integers less than r giving the pivot
  positions, the first nonzero positions in each of the basis vectors.

Lie_type: (string->LieType): interpret string as Lie type.
  Factors are one of "ABCDEFGT" followed by a number; several factors can be
  concatenated in a string with optional punctuation. Must have total rank<=32
extend: (Lie_type,string,int->Lie_type): add a single (type,rank) pair to type
  In extend(lt,t,r), a factor (type,r) is added to the Lie type lt, where type
  is given by the first character of t (or is 'T' if t is the empty string).
operator * : (LieType,LieType->LieType): concatenate Lie types
Lie_type: (RootDatum->LieType): Lie type of a root datum.

operators =, != : (LieType,LieType->bool) equality of Lie types (order matters)
operator % : (LieType->[string,int]) Expand into row of simple factors codes
  Each simple factor is described by a one-letter string and an integer rank,
  while factors ("T",1) are contributions to the central torus

Cartan_matrix: (LieType->mat): Cartan matrix of Lie type (square of size rank).
  A block form Cartan matrix, with zeros in rows and columns of torus factors
Cartan_matrix_type: (mat->LieType,[int]): type given by Cartan matrix.
  The input should be a Cartan matrix for a semisimple type (no zero rows or
  columns). The function returns the semisimple type, and the permutation of
  mapping the standard (Bourbaki) ordering of the diagram of that type to the
  ordering of the corresponding simple roots in matrix rows and columns.

Smith_Cartan: (LieType->mat,vec): generators of weights modulo roots.
  Find a Smith basis for the weight lattice relative to the sublattice of
  roots, with corresponding invariant factors. It is almost equivalent to
  Smith(^Cartan_matrix(type)), except that (1) Smith_Cartan produces a
  separate diagonal block for each simple or torus factor, (2) for factors 'T'
  of the Lie type, Smith_Cartan produces a column with just '1' on the
  diagonal, but with corresponding "invariant factor" set equal to '0', and
  (3) for factors D_{2n} an equivalent basis is given, which has been tweaked
  so that the final two vectors are standard basis vectors.

filter_units: (mat,vec->mat,vec): discard entries '1' and their columns.
  The input is presumably produced by 'Smith_Cartan' or 'adapted_basis'; for
  all positions where the second (vector) component has '1', that entry and
  the corresponding column of the first matrix is discarded; what is left of
  the matrix and the vector is returned. If the vector has fewer entries than
  the matrix has columns (cf. adapted_basis), missing entries count as not 1.

ann_mod: (mat,int->mat): find maximal matrix with product divisible by d.
  The call ann_mod(M,d) finds a square matrix A whose columns have the same
  height as those of M and span a maximal sublattice subject to the condition
  that the scalar product of every column of A with every column of M is
  divisible by d (the matrix product ^A*M vanishes modulo d).

replace_gen: ((mat,vec),mat->mat): replace generators of weight lattice.
  The arguments are as for 'filter_units'. For every entry different from '1'
  in the vector argument, replace a column from the first matrix by a column
  from the second matrix. Both matrices must have the same column size; like
  for 'filter_units' the vector may be short, missing entries being not 1.

involution: (LieType,[int],string->mat): diagram involution for inner class.
  Return an involution matrix for simply connected times central torus datum,
  given by the Lie type and the permutation (second argument, which maps
  positions in the diagram to positions in the root list), the involution being
  described symbolically by the string. It is interpreted as the inner class
  string is in Fokko, where 'e' or 'c' mean compact (equal rank), 'u' means
  unequal rank (for types A_n with n>1, D_n and E_6), 's' means split, and
  'C' means Complex. The result is almost always a permutation matrix, but for
  the split type on (central) torus factors there is a diagonal entry -1
involution: (LieType,mat,string->mat): basic involution on given basis.
  This is like previous 'involution' for the same Lie type and inner class
  string, but the involution matrix is now expressed the given basis given by
  the columns of the matrix specified as second argument; this expression must
  be possible, so the sublattice spanned should be stable under the involution

root_datum: (mat,mat,bool->RootDatum): root datum from simple (co)root systems.
  In root_datum(roots,coroots), matrices roots and coroots must have the same
  dimensions (rank x semisimple rank); their columns give the desired systems
  of simple roots respectively simple coroots. The matrix of pairings of roots
  and coroots should be a valid Cartan matrix. A root datum with those systems
  of simple roots and simple coroots is returned. The final argument tells
  whether the coroots rather than the roots should be ordered by increasing
  level (in all cases corresponding roots ad coroots are at the same index).
root_datum: (LieType,mat,bool->RootDatum): root datum from type and sublattice.
  The columns of the matrix argument are interpreted as specifying the basis
  of a sublattice of the character lattice of the "simply connected" group G
  of the given Lie type (which is a direct product of a simply connected
  semisimple group G' and a central torus S), expressed in the basis of
  fundamental weights of G' and an arbitrary basis for characters of S). For
  this to be possible, it is required that the sublattice contain the root
  lattice of G'. The sublattice becomes the standard lattice X^* for the root
  datum, and is identified with Z^n using the given basis. The final argument
  has the same meaning as when constructing from simple (co)root matrices.
root_datum: (RootDatum,mat->RootDatum): root datum for sublattice in old one
  This is like root_datum@(LieType,mat), but starting from the specified root
  datum rd rather than from the simply connected one for the Lie type. The
  provided sublattice matrix must be square and full rank (invertible of the
  rational numbers) and the roots of rd must be in its integral column span.
root_datum: (InnerClass->RootDatum): root datum of inner class.
  Extract the root datum from the InnerClass value

operators =, != : (RootDatum,RootDatum->bool) equality of Root data
  Tests identical simple_roots, simple_coroots matrices, and prefers_coroots
prefers_coroots: (RootDatum->bool): whether coroots were used for generation
  This recovers the attribute governing the order of roots and coroots, set
  during construction from argument or inheriting from an earlier root datum.
Cartan_matrix: (RootDatum->mat): Cartan matrix of root datum.
  This pairs roots and coroots, so it is square, of size the semisimple rank.
  By force of convention, rows correspond to roots and columns to coroots.

simply_connected: (LieType,bool->RootDatum): "simply connected" datum for type.
  This gives the root datum for the "simply connected" group of the given type
  (the direct product of a simply connected G' with a central torus): one has
    simply_connected_datum(type,b) = root_datum(type,id_mat(rank),b)
  The final argument has the 'refers_coroots' meaning, as in root_datum versions

adjoint: (LieType,bool->RootDatum): "adjoint" root datum for given type.
  Here the sublattice for the semisimple factor is the root lattice, with
  simple roots as basis; for the central torus an arbitrary basis is used.
  Dual to simply_connected: adjoint(type,b) = dual(simply_connected(type,not b))
  The final argument has the 'refers_coroots' meaning, as in root_datum versions

root, coroot: (RootDatum,int->vec): root/cooroot with given index in root system
  Indexing is from -nr_of_posroots(rd) upto nr_of_posroots(rd)-1, with
  negative indices giving negative (co)roots, and non-negative indices giving
  positive (co)roots; simple (co)roots are consecutive from index 0 upwards.

simple_roots: (RootDatum->mat): matrix of simple roots in the root datum.
simple_coroots: (RootDatum->mat): matrix of simple coroots in the root datum.
posroots: (RootDatum->mat): matrix of positive roots in the root datum.
poscoroots: (RootDatum->mat): matrix of positive coroots in the root datum.
  Individual roots/coroots are columns of these matrices, which is somewhat
  unnatural in the case of coroots, but necessary to be able to do a for-loop
  over these matrices, which loops over its columns. The result is given as a
  matrix instead of as a list of vectors because this retains the information
  about the rank (number of rows of the matrix) even when there are 0 columns.

roots: (RootDatum->mat): full set of roots of root datum (columns of result).
coroots: (RootDatum->mat): full set of coroots of root datum (as columns).
  Since these include negative roots/coroots, the numbering of the columns
  (necessarily starting at 0) is shifted with respect to the indexing given by
  the root/coroot functions (which have negative roots at negative indices).

root_coradical: (RootDatum->mat): simple roots and coradical basis.
  With respect to simple_roots, add columns for coradical basis generators
coroot_radical: (RootDatum->mat): simple coroots and radical basis.
  With respect to simple_coroots, add columns for radical basis generators
fundamental_weight: (RootDatum,int->ratvec): fundamental weight number $i$
fundamental_coweight: (RootDatum,int->ratvec): fundamental coweight number $i$
dual: (RootDatum->RootDatum): dual of given root datum.
  This operation preserves the numbering of the roots, interchanging just what
  it calls roots and coroots. This implies that the ordering may differ from
  the one in which a root datum for the dual type would be constructed in
  isolation: notably the final root of |dual(rd)| may not be its highest one,
  even if the root datum is of semisimple type.
derived_info: (RootDatum->RootDatum,mat): information for the derived group
  The first result is the root datum for the derived group itself, the second
  result is a matrix mapping weights from the original to the derived datum.
mod_central_torus_info: (RootDatum->RootDatum,mat): quotient by central torus
  The (semisimple) root datum obtained by quotienting by the central torus,
  and matrix embedding weights for the quotient datum into the original datum.
rank: (RootDatum->int) Rank of the weight lattice for this Lie type.
semisimple_rank: (RootDatum->int) Rank of the root lattice of  this Lie type.
nr_of_posroots: (RootDatum->int) Number of positive roots in the root datum.

root_index: (RootDatum,vec->int): Index of root with respect to posroots
coroot_index: (RootDatum,vec->int): Index of coroot with respect to poscoroots
  These functions return the index of the root/coroot in the root system rd, or
  return nr_of_posroots(rd) if the argument is not found among the (co)roots.
  The indexing is as in the root/coroot functions above, so if fond the index i
  returned has -nr_of_posroots(rd) <= i < nr_of_posroots(rd).

integrality_datum: (RootDatum,ratvec->RootDatum): integral coroots subdatum
  Applied to (rd,gamma), forms the root datum whose coroots form the closed
  subsystem of the coroots of rd that take an integral value on gamma.

integrality_points: (RootDatum,ratvec->[rat]): fractions with integrality
  The call integrality_points(rd,lambda) returns the increasing list of
  positive fractions f<=1 so f*lambda has more integrality than generically:
  for some coroot alphav one has integral and nonzero value <alphav,f*lambda>.

quotient_basis: (LieType,[ratvec]->mat): sublattice given by kernel generators.
  Interpret the rational vectors as kernel generators for the given type, as
  in the Fokko program, and return the corresponding sublattice as a matrix
  whose column are its generators. More precisely, the rational vectors
  represent linear combinations of certain coweights in the dual basis to a
  basis of the weight lattice adapted to the root lattice; for those weights
  in the latter basis that already lie in the root lattice, the corresponding
  coweight is omitted, since there are no useful rational multiples of it
  anyway. Return a basis for the sublattice of X^* of weights on which all
  kernel generators have integer evaluation. If M is the matrix whose columns
  are the numerators of the kernel generators, brought to a common denominator
  d, this amounts to setting S=Smith_Cartan(type) and (C,)=filter_units(S),
  and then returning the value replace_gen(S,C*ann_mod(M,d)).
  This function is intended for use in constructing root data; see basic.at

classify_involution: (mat->int,int,int): determine type of lattice involution
  For any linear involution of Z^n, there is a basis consisting of certain
  vectors that are eigenvectors with eigenvalues 1 or -1 for the involution,
  and of pairs of vectors that are interchanged by the involution. The numbers
  of such vectors for each eigenvalue and of interchanged pairs determine the
  involution up to base change. This function, which requires its argument to
  be the matrix of an involution, returns these three numbers in the following
  order: eigenvectors for 1 (compact rank), pairs of interchanged vectors
  (Complex rank), eigenvectors for -1 (split rank).

inner_class: (RootDatum,mat->InnerClass): inner_class of G from involution
  This is the basic function for building a complex reductive group equipped
  with an involution from the root datum and that involution; the latter is
  given on the lattice basis of the root datum, and must describe an
  involutive automorphism of the root datum. The involution is converted to a
  based root datum involution if necessary, using the Weyl group.
twisted_involution (RootDatum,mat->InnerClass,vec): inner_class and Weyl word
  Build an inner class as the above function, and also return a Weyl word
  (twisted involution) that expresses the given involution in that inner
  class. The latter is a reduced word (with Weyl group generators numbered
  from 0), to be left-multiplied to the distinguished involution.
inner_class: (Lie_type,[ratvec],string->InnerClass): inner class as in Fokko
    set inner_class(Lie_type lt,[ratvec] gens,string ic_string) =
    let basis=quotient_basis(lt,gens)
    ; rd=root_datum(lt,basis), inv=based_involution(lt,basis,ic_string)
    in inner_class(rd,inv).

operators =, != : (InnerClass,InnerClass->bool): (non)identity of inner classes
  Equality holds only when both arguments refer to the same inner class
  creation, in other words it will recognize ic=inner_class(real_form(ic,0)) as
  true, but any freshly built inner class tests unequal to anything preexisting
distinguished_involution: (InnerClass->mat): involution of the inner class.
  Extract the distinguished involution of X^* that defines the inner class
dual: (InnerClass->InnerClass): dual inner class for dual complex group

nr_of_real_forms: (InnerClass->int): number of real forms in inner class
nr_of_dual_real_forms: (InnerClass->int): number of dual forms in inner class
nr_of_Cartan_classes: (InnerClass->int): total number of Cartans in inner class

block_sizes: (InnerClass->mat): matrix giving the block sizes.
  This is essentially the same as the output of 'blocksizes' in Fokko; the
  rows of the matrix correspond to real forms for the inner class, and the
  columns correspond to dual real forms for the inner class

form_names: (InnerClass->[string]): list of names of real forms.
  These are the same names used in Fokko, describing real Lie algebras
dual_form_names: (InnerClass->[string]): list of names of dual real forms.
  These are the names for the real forms of the dual InnerClass value

occurrence_matrix: (InnerClass->mat): real form-Cartan class incidence matrix
  For the given inner class, construct a matrix whose rows are parametrized by
  the real forms, and whose columns are parametrized by the Cartan classes,
  showing whether (1) or not (0) the Cartan class occurs for the real form
dual_occurrence_matrix: (InnerClass->mat): dual real form-Cartan class matrix
  This is like occurrence_matrix, but with rows representing dual real forms


real_form: (InnerClass,int->RealForm): select a real form from inner class.
  The result of form_names describes the valid range and names of real forms;
  this function actually constructs a real form from the list, selected by its
  position (starting from 0). The list is always the same for a given inner
  class (independent of other computations), unlike the list of Cartan classes
  for a real form as discussed below
inner_class: (RealForm->InnerClass): inner class containing the form
form_number: (RealForm->int): index of the real form in its inner class

quasisplit_form: (InnerClass->RealForm): quasisplit form for the inner class
  This is the last one in the list of real forms for the fundamental Cartan
  (number 0 in the list) of the inner class

components_rank: (RealForm->int): rank of the component group
  The group of connected components of the real Lie group defined by a real
  form is an elementary 2-group (Z/2Z vector space); this function gives its
  rank, so the number of connected components is 2^components_rank(rf)

count_Cartans: (RealForm->int): number of Cartan classes for this real form
  The Cartan classes are actually constructed, and remembered, by this command
  whence its first execution for some real form may take some time

operators =, !=: (RealForm,RealForm->bool): (in)equality of real forms
  It means they belong to an identical inner class (not two inner classes
  created separately from identical argumnets), and have same form number

KGB_size: (RealForm->int): size of the set K\G/B for this real form
base_grading_vector: (RealForm->ratvec): Offset implicit in torus_bits values
  The binary vectors torus_bits for elements of the KGB associated to a real
  form are relative to a special torus element t0, and this function produces
  a dominant rational coweight c for which \exp(\pi i c) equals this t0.
  The choice of t0 and of c are constant for each "square class" of real forms
  (which are grouped together in the output of print_strong_real for the
  fundamental Cartan), for which the squares of any of their strong
  involutions are the same torus element z: the choice of c is subject to
  \exp(2\pi i(c+rho_check))=z which reflects (t0)^2\exp(2\pi i rho_check)=z.
  Apart from z, the choice of c (or of t0) defines an implicit "base grading"
  of the simple roots at the distinguished involution of the inner class, by
  the parity of the (integer) pairing of c with the simple root. Here "odd"
  corresponds to grading 0, due to the mentioned rho_check: so c differs by
  rho_check from some "infinitesimal cocharacter" g chosen for the real form.
  A standard choice for c is determined by the base grading for the  weak real
  form, whence the name of this function. However for real forms synthesized
  by the function real_form@(InnerClass,mat,ratvec), the arguments of that
  call may determine a different value of z, in which case a different choice
  for c is made to match it. The choice of c then depends on z only; in
  particular it will be the same for real forms synthesized using different
  strong involutions for the same real group, and such groups will test equal.

Cartan_order: (RealForm->mat): matrix describing ordering of Cartan classes
  The Cartan classes for a given real form form a partially ordered set; this
  function returns this partial ordering in the form of a square 0-1 matrix
KGB_Hasse: (RealForm->mat): Hasse diagram of Bruhat order on K\G/B
  The Bruhat order x<=y among K-orbits in G/B describes when x is contained in
  the (topological) closure of y. KGB_Hasse(G) is a matrix describing the Hasse
  diagram of this finite partial order: the set of pairs (x,z) for which the
  interval { y | x<=y<=z } contains exaclty the two elements, namely x et z.
  The matrix is indexed by the numbers #x of the K\G/B elements x, and the
  entry at (#x,#z) is 1 when (x,z) is in the Hasse diagram, and 0 othewise.

dual_real_form: (InnerClass,int->RealForm): select a dual real form
  This is like real_form, but selects a dual real form for the inner class
  (whose names are given by dual_form_names) by index. This is intended for
  functions that require both a real form and a dual real form for a given
  inner class; the compatibility between them is tested by a runtime check.
dual_quasisplit_form: (InnerClass->RealForm): quasisplit dual real form

Cartan_class: (InnerClass,int->CartanClass): Cartan class selected by number
  This selects a Cartan class by number in the list of all Cartan classes for
  this inner class. The numbering is fixed, and compatible with  the partial
  ordering on Cartan classes where more split ones are considered greater

Cartan_class: (RealForm,int->CartanClass): Cartan class selected by number
  This selects a Cartan class by number in the list of Cartan classes defined
  for this real form. The numbering is not the same as when selecting a Cartan
  class directly from an inner class, unless the real form is quasisplit.

most_split_Cartan: (RealForm->CartanClass): most split Cartan class for form
  The most split Cartan class of a given real form is the last one in the list
  of its Cartan classes, so
    set most_split_Cartan(RealForm rf)=Cartan_class(rf,count_Cartans(rf)-1)

involution: (CartanClass->mat): weight lattice involution for Cartan class
Cartan_info: (CartanClass->(int,int,int),vec,(int,int),(LieType,LieType,LieType)):
  Information about the Cartan class, essentially that given by the output of
  'cartan' in Fokko (except for the final partition corresponding to the real
  forms for this Cartan class, for which see fiber_partition).
  The first triple of integers gives in order the number of compact (U(1)),
  complex (GL(1,C)), and split (GL(1,R)) factors of the real torus defined by
  this Cartan class. Follows the canonical twisted involution for the Cartan
  class, a pair of integers giving the number of distinct twisted involutions
  defining this same Cartan class and their fiber size, and finally the types
  of the imaginary, real, and complex root subsystems (note the order here).

real_forms: (CartanClass->[RealForm]): list of real forms with given Cartan
  Returns a list of the real forms for which this Cartan class occurs
dual_real_forms: (CartanClass->[RealForm]): list Cartan's dual real forms
  Returns a list of the dual real forms for which this Cartan class occurs

square_classes: (CartanClass->[[int]]): partition real forms by square class
  This returns a list of lists of numbers that identify real forms in the
  inner class. All real forms whose representative strong involutions may
  square to the same value in the center are grouped together in a sublist
  (the number of sublists is a power of 2). Each number occurs only in a
  single sublist, but may be repeated, which indicates that there are multiple
  orbits of strong involutions (strong real forms) for the same real form.
  The value returned represents a part of the print_strong_real output.
fiber_partition: (CartanClass,RealForm->[int]): identifying part of fiber group
  This produces an increasing sequence of integers that characterizes the real
  form relative to the CartanClass. It describes a part of the adjoint fiber
  group associated to the Cartan class (an elementary 2-group of rank r equal
  to the number of compact factors of the real torus in the _adjoint_ group
  defined by the Cartan class), whose elements are represented by numbers 0 to
  2^r-1; as the real form traverses all those for which this Cartan class
  occurs, the results of the function form a partition of that set of numbers.

real_form: (InnerClass,mat,ratvec->RealForm): real form from strong real form
  Synthesize a real form defined by an involution and a torus factor. With
  arguments (ic,M,v), the matrix M should define an involution theta in the
  inner class. The rational vector v, after being made right M-fixed by right
  multiplication by (M+1)/2, defines a torus element \exp(\pi i v) whose
  square must be central, which means that v*alpha must be integral for all
  (simple) roots alpha. If this holds then theta and torus_factor v together
  define a strong involution representative. The function returns the strong
  real form rf identified by that strong involution. It may differ from
  real_form(ic,form_number(rf)), the standard version of this weak real form;
  the difference can be seen through the value of base_grading_vector(rf), and
  in the RealForm equality test (because of this distinction, one may consider
  the result to represent a strong real form). Real forms produced by this
  function are said to be synthesized (rather than selected). A subsequent
  call KGB_elt(rf,theta,v) should always produce a valid KGB element x. The
  grading of the imaginary roots alpha for theta defined by this x will be
  given by the parity of < v+\check\rho_i, \alpha >, where \check\rho_i is
  half the sum of the positive imaginary coroots for M (its presence in the
  formula ensures that v=0 is always valid, and grades all simple-imaginary
  roots as noncompact). This grading is the most tangible aspect of (theta,v),
  but only determines the weak real form, and may fail to identify a unique
  KGB element x; this function and the mentioned instance of KGB_elt are
  faithful beyond just reconstructing the correct grading.
central_fiber: (RealForm->[vec]): Set of torus bits not affecting any gradings
  These are binary vectors that can be added to |torus_bits| of KGB elements
  in the fundamental fiber to get another KGB element giving the same status
  (including compactness of imaginary roots) to every simple root; adding any
  of these values to torus bits defines an automorphism of the KGB structure
initial_torus_bits: (RealForm->vec) Torus bits for initial KGB element
  This is a test function, computing what should be the torus bits of KGB(G,0)
  independently of what is currently set in the implementation. They could
  differ from reality by an element of |central_fiber(G)|. This function can
  be removed once the same computation will actually replace the implemented
  choice for the torus bits with which the KGB construction starts off.

KGB: (RealForm,int->KGBElt): select a KGB element x among those of a real form
  The call KGB(i,rf) selects the element in line i of the print_KGB(rf)
  output.
%: (KGBElt->RealForm,int): real form and number; inverse of KGB@(RealForm,int)
Cartan_class: (KGBElt->CartanClass): the Cartan class for the KGB element
involution: (KGBElt->mat): the involution of X^* associated to the KGB element
length: (KGBElt->int): length of the element within its KGB set
status: (int,KGBElt->int): status of generator on KGB element, scale 0..4
  Encoding 0: Complex descent, 1: imaginary compact, 2: real,
  3: imaginary non-compact, 4: Complex ascent
status: (vec,KGBElt->int): status of any root on KGB element, scale 0..4
  The value status(alpha,x) gives the status of the root alpha at x; the
  encoding of statuses is the same as for the function status@(int,KGBElt)
cross: (int,KGBElt->KGBElt): cross action for (posrootnr,KGB element)
  Returns result of cross action by root reflection of the given KGB element
Cayley: (int,KGBElt->KGBElt): Cayley transform for (posrootnr,KGB element)
  Returns either the Cayley transform or an inverse Cayley transform of the
  KGB element through the given positive root, or returns that element itself
  when neither is defined. If defined, one can find which it is using status,
  and whether there is a second inverse Cayley transform can be found out by
  applying cross action to the result; it either returns the same result,
  which signifies a single-value inverse Cayley, or else the second value
twist: (KGBElt->KGBElt): twist of KGB element x, useful for Hermitian dual
  This is defined by conjugation of x by the distinguished involution delta
twist: (KGBElt,mat->KGBElt): twist of KGB element x by an external involution
  The result of conjugation of x by the given involution of the weight lattice
torus_factor: (KGBElt->ratvec): coweight for KGB element, twice that in print_X
  This is a \theta^t stable rational vector v with integral evaluations on
  all imaginary roots; interpreted modulo the image of 1+\theta^t acting
  on X_*, so in particular modulo (2\Z)^n. For an imaginary root \alpha
  the scalar product < v + \check\rho_i , \alpha > determines whether \alpha
  is compact (if even) or noncompact (if odd). Together with the inner class
  and the involution, this value completely characterizes the KGB element (and
  its real form), and it can be reconstructed using the KGB_elt function below.
torus_bits: (KGBElt->vec): torus part of KGB element as vector of 0,1 values
  A vector of size the rank that distinguishes between different KGB elements
  at the same involution, in the format used internally. From this the value
  torus_factor(x) is computed using base_grading_vector(rf)-torus_bits(x), for
  the real form rf of x, which value is then symmetrized for \theta^t.
KGB_elt: (RealForm,mat,ratvec): KGB element defined by rational coweight
  This function finds a KGB element x such that real_form(x), involution(x),
  and torus_factor(x) match the values (rf,M,v) given as arguments. The
  interpretation for the (involution) matrix M and rational (coweight) vector
  v are as for real_form@(InnerClass,mat,ratvec); moreover rf should be equal
  to the real form returned (for this inner class) by real_form(ic,M,v), and
  the difference v-base_grading_vector(rf) must be an integer vector. There is
  then at most one KGB element x for rf such that torus_factor(x) is congruent
  to v modulo the image of ^M+1 (i.e., M+1 applied on right), which x is then
  returned by this function (if no such x is found, an error is signaled).

operators =, != : (KGBElt,KGBElt): equality of elements of a same KGB set
  Equality of KGB elements implies equality of their real forms, and thereby
  the fact that they have identical (not created separately) inner classes

block: (RealForm,RealForm->Block): construct traditional block as in Fokko
%: (Block->RealForm,RealForm): decompose block, inverse of 'block'
#: (Block->int): number of elements of block
element: (Block,int->KGBElt,KGBElt): KGB and dual KGB values for block element
index (Block,KGBElt,KGBElt->int): index in block, from KGB, dual KGB components
  This is the inverse of the map defined by element@(Block,int): given a
  compatible pair of a KGB element x and a dual KGB element y, it returns the
  index in the block of the corresponding element. For efficiency reasons the
  function requires the containing block to be supplied as first argument; if
  needed, block(real_form(x),dual_real_form(real_form(y))) computes the block
dual: (Block->Block): dual block, with real form and dual real form swapped
status: (int,Block,int->): status at a block element of a simple reflection
  For s the index of a reflection, and i the index of an element of block b,
  status(s,b,i) gives according to the codes 0:C-, 1:ic, 2:r1, 3:r2,  4:C+,
  5: rn, 6:i1, 7:i2. Note that the descents s have status(b,i,s)<4


param: (KGBElt,vec,ratvec->Param): form parameter from (x,lambda-rho,nu)
operator % : (Param->KGBElt,vec,ratvec): recover (x,lambda-rho,nu) from param
real_form: (Param->RealForm): recover the real form from a Param value
infinitesimal_character: (Param->ratvec): infinitesimal character of parameter
  This is actually a representative of the infinitesimal character, given by
  gamma = ((1+theta)lambda+(1-theta)nu)/2. The meaning of the x component of
  the parameter is determined by its position relative to this representative
  gamma, so to find the x value uniquely associated to the representation for
  the parameter, one should apply the function 'dominant' to the parameter
  first, after which the value of infinitesimal_character is indeed dominant
is_standard: (Param->bool): whether parameter defines a standard module
  This is true whenever gamma is dominant relative to the imaginary roots
is_zero: (Param->bool): whether parameter defines a zero standard module
  True whenever gamma is singular on a compact (for x) simple-imaginary root
is_semifinal: (Param->bool): whether parameter has no singular real descents
  False whenever associated standard representation is combination of others
  on more compact Cartans by a Hecht-Schmid identity. So is_semifinal(p) is
  true provided no real coroots for which gamma is singular satisfy the parity
  condition. Note: one could still have is_zero(p); this needs a separate test.
is_final: (Param->bool): whether p parameterizes an irreducible representation
  This means that is_standard(p) and not is_zero(p) and is_semifinal(p) holds,
  as well as p=dominant(p)=normal(p). Parameters that satisfy |is_final(p)|
  are the ones that can occur as monomials in a |ParamPol| value.
equivalent : (Param,Param->bool): test equivalence of parameters
  Equivalence allows the infinitesimal character (representative) of any
  standard parameter to be made dominant, and among such parameters is defined
  as reachability of one from the other using singular complex cross actions.
  If either parameter fails to be standard, this reverts to strict equality,
  otherwise the equivalent(p,q) amounts to the same as normal(p)=normal(q).
dominant: (Param->Param): ensure parameter has dominant infinitesimal character
  This gives an equivalent form of the parameter in which the infinitesimal
  character has been made dominant (it may not be unique for this property)
normal: (Param->Param): bring parameter to a canonical form under equivalence
  This form has dominant infinitesimal character and no singular complex
  descents; there may be more than one such form, of which a preferred one is
  chosen (terms in a ParamPol are always normalized, and moreover have
  is_final(p) and not is_zero(p); in this case the form described is unique).
cross: (int,Param->Param): cross action for (Weyl group generator,parameter)
  This first argument indexes (starting at 0) a simple root for the subsystem
  for the given parameter p: integrality_datum(infinitesimal_character(p))
Cayley: (int,Param->Param): Cayley transform for (Weyl generator,parameter)
  If (and only if) the transform is undefined it returns the same parameter
  Find out possible second value by applying cross action to the result
inv_Cayley: (int,Param->Param): inverse Cayley transform
  If (and only if) the inverse transform is undefined it returns the same
  parameter. Find out possible second value of inverse transform by applying
  cross action to the result, which either produces it or else fixes result
cross: (vec,Param->Param): cross action for (root,parameter)
Cayley: (vec,Param->Param): Cayley transform for (root,parameter)
  These two functions should do the same as the three before, but taking the
  root in coordinates, and combining the Cayley/inverse Cayley into one
  function (whichever is defined is applied, or else the parameter returned).
  The implementation is quite independent however, so comparison is useful.
twist: (Param->Param): twist the parameter by the distinguished involution
twist: (Param,mat->Param): twist the parameter by the given external involution
orientation_nr: (Param->int): the orientation number
reducibility_points: (Param->[rat]): the 0<t<=1 with I(x,lambda,t\nu) reducible
operator * : (Param,rat->Param): scale component nu by given rational factor
at_nu_0 : (Param->Param): reduce component nu to 0 (scale it be a factor 0)

print_block: (Param->): print (non-integral) block generated from parameter
block: (Param->[Param],int): return block as list of parameters, and index
  The second component is the index into the first of the original parameter.
partial_block: (Param->[Param]): return partial block as list of parameters
  This is the Bruhat interval of the block below the given parameter,
  sorted by length and including the given parameter as final element
length: (Param->int): the length of a parameter within its block
KL_block: (Param->[Param],int,mat,[vec],vec,vec,mat): block, raw_KL, and more
  This combines block with the Kazhdan-Lustzig table for the block appended,
  and two more values that allow cumulation to be performed. The two values of
  block are followed by three values in the format of raw_KL below: a matrix
  of indices into the following list of polynomials, coded as a list of
  coefficient vectors, then a list of indices where the length function
  increases. Finally follow a vector with indices of the "surviving" block
  elements, and a matrix whose rows correspond to those survivors, its columns
  to all block elements, and whose the entries gives the coefficients by which
  each the block element (column) contributes to the surviving element (row),
  with a sign given by the parity of their length difference. Here "surviving"
  refers to the result of applying a translation functor to a standard module,
  namely a functor from regular infinitesimal character to the current
  (possibly) singular infinitesimal character. Thus one can transform the
  given KL matrix (computed at regular infinitesimal character) to one at the
  actual block by selecting only the columns whose index is among the
  survivors, and multiplying the resulting matrix on the left by the
  contribution-coefficient matrix (the final component this function returns).
dual_KL_block: (Param->[Param],int,mat,[vec],vec,vec): KL info for dual block
  This closely corresponds to KL_block, but computes the KL polynomials for
  the formally dual block. Here the type of the simple roots are dualised,
  interchanging for instance imaginary compact and real nonparity and likewise
  imaginary type 1 and real type 2. To make this valid, the order of the block
  elements is reversed, and other changes made: adapting the indices of length
  function changes and of surviving elements. The contribution-coefficient
  matrix is omitted altogether, as it is not to be used for the dual block.
partial_KL_block: (Param->[Param],mat,[vec],vec,vec,mat): partial KL_block
  This function relates to KL_block as partial_block relates to block. The
  first component of the result is the Bruhat interval as in partial_block,
  and all other components are the same is in KL_block (except that the now
  superfluous second component of KL_block is omitted), but with the two vec
  components filtered so as to be indexed by the Bruhat interval indices only.
extended_block: (Param,mat->[Param],mat,mat,mat) extended block with graph data
  The arguments are a parameter p and an external distinguished involution delta
  (which should commute with the inner class distinguished involution). The
  block of p is constructed as in block@Param, and the (possibly empty) list of
  its parameters fixed by the action of delta returned as first component. The
  remaining three components are matrices indexed by (in this order) an index
  into the list of parameters and an index in the delta-folded Dynkin diagram
  (an extended generator), and containing for the first matrix a code for the
  type of the parameter for the generator, and for the other two matrices the
  indices of the neighbors for this generator (two for double-valued Cayley
  transforms or for single-valued ones with in addition a cross action, one for
  a complex cross action, none for cases like a compact imaginary generator).
  Every parameter in the extended block has an implicit choice of extended
  parameter attached, with respect to which choices certain neighbor relations
  may involve a sign flip, which is indicated in the corresponding matrix entry
  (link value): if the extended block has size n, then link values from 0 to n-1
  indicate a neighbor with no flip, negative values from -1 to -n indicate a
  sign flip (for the index corresponding by subtraction from -1), and the value
  n indicates absence of a link.

operators =, != : (Split->bool): test split integer against Split:(0,0)
operators =, != : (Split,Split->bool): equality/inequality of split integers
operator + : (Split,Split->Split): addition of split integers
operator - : (Split,Split->Split): subtraction of split integers
operator - : (Split->Split): negation of a split integer
operator * : (Split,Split->Split): multiplication of split integers
operator % : (Split,int,int): decomposition of split integer into components

null_module: (RealForm->ParamPol): empty sum of parameters for the real form
real_form: (ParamPol->RealForm): recover the real form from a ParamPol value
operator # : (ParamPol->int): number of nonzero terms of the formal sum
operators =, != : (ParamPol->bool): test virtual module for being zero
operators =, != : (ParamPol,ParamPol->bool): test virtual modules for equality
operator +, - : (ParamPol,Param->ParamPol): add/subtract parameter to formal sum
operator + : (ParamPol,(Split,Param)->ParamPol): add parameter with coefficient
operator + : (ParamPol,[(Split,Param)]->ParamPol): add terms to formal sum
operators +, - : (ParamPol,ParamPol->ParamPol): addition/subtraction formal sums
operator * : (int,ParamPol->ParamPol): integer multiple of a formal sum
operator * : (Split,ParamPol->ParamPol): split integer multiple of a formal sum
last_term: (ParamPol->Split,Param): highest term (for #x(p)) of non-empty module
first_term: (ParamPol->Split,Param): lowest term (for #x(p)) of non-empty module
operator * : (ParamPol,rat->ParamPol): scale nu in each term, and renormalize
  After scaling the continuous part of the parameter in each term, some may no
  longer be dominant or final, and need to be rewritten in the same way as
  parameters are when incorporated into a ParamPol; this is the renormalization
at_nu_0 : (ParamPol->ParamPol): scale nu in each term by 0

K_type_formula: (Param->ParamPol) Express K-type in terms of standardrepns|_K
  The argument parameter is interpreted as giving an irreducible module; its
  restriction to K is expressed as linear combination of restrictions to K of
  standard representations, and a polynomial giving their parameters returned.
branch: (Param,int->ParamPol) Find K-types of standardrepn up to given limit
  The first argument is taken as standard representation, and is interpreted
  as restricted to K (the nu component is replaced by a zero vector), while
  the second argument is a bound on the height; the result should be
  interpreted as linear combination of K-types, each standard final parameter
  term (which will have nu=0) standing for its lowest K-type.
branch: (ParamPol,int->ParamPol) Find K-types of polynomial up to given limit
  This is just forming the Split-linear combination for all terms of the
  results of branch on the standard representations for those terms
to_canonical: (Param->Param) Move parameter to canonical fiber (making nu=0)
height: (Param->int) W-invariant height measure standardrepn restricted to K
  This is the sum of absolute values of the scalar products of (1+theta)lambda
  and the positive coroots; it ignores the nu component of the parameter.
  This is the same function as used in branch to compare with the given limit.

deform: (Param->ParamPol): compute deformation terms when nu decreases
  The non-integral block for the parameter and its KL polynomials are
  computed, from which the deformation terms involving other members of the
  block are computed. They are returned as a formal sum of parameters with
  split integer coefficients, which are in fact integer multiples of (1-s).
twisted_deform: (Param->ParamPol): inner class twisted deformation terms
  This is like deform, but uses the twisted KL polynomials (for the inner class
  involution) instead. The argument parameter must be fixed under that twist.

full_deform: (Param->ParamPol): perform deformation all the way to nu=0
  This is like deform, but recursively deforms all new terms produced as long
  as they do not have nu=0; all terms in the result therefore have nu=0.
twisted_full_deform: (Param->ParamPol): inner class twisted deformation to nu=0
  This is like full_deform, but uses the twisted KL polynomials (for the inner
  class involution) instead. The parameter must be fixed under that twist.

KL_sum_at_s: (Param->ParamPol): signed sum of KL polynomials at s, fixed y
  Computes \sum_{x\leq y}(-1)^{l(y)-l(x)}P_{x,y}[q:=s].x where y is the block
  element of the parameter, and the sum is over other block elements x.
twisted_KL_sum_at_s: (Param->ParamPol): KL_sum_at_s, twisted KLV polynomials
  This does the same sum as KL_sum_at_s, but using twisted KLV polynomials
  (the twist is for the distinguished involution) instead of ordinary KLV
  polynomials. The actual value depends on sign choices for Hecke module
  generators associated to the terms, so individual terms in the result are
  mathematically well defined only up to a possible factor -1; however
  consistent internal choices (default extensions) make the signs well-defined
twisted_KL_sum_at_s: (Param,mat->ParamPol): sum of delta-twisted KLV polynomials
  This version takes an explicit external involution matrix delta as second
  argument. The parameter should be delta-fixed. Unlike the previous two, this
  function does not tabulate results or look up previously computed ones.
scale_extended: (Param,mat,rat->Param,bool) scale nu, recording extended flips
  When interpreting parameters as representing a representation of the
  delta-extended group (where delta is the second argument, a distinguished
  involution commuting with the one defining the inner class), certain
  changes to parameters may flip the default choice of extended representation;
  this function takes care to record such a flip for the operation of scaling
  the continuous component nu by a rational factor. With arguments (p,delta,f)
  it is supposed that gamma(p) is dominant (if not, the function dominant is
  applied without recording any flips); then a new parameter q is formed by
  scaling the component nu(p) by f. In case gamma(q) is non-dominant (due to
  some complex roots), it is then made dominant; in this phase any flip to the
  default choice of delta-extended representation is recorded. Finally the
  modified q and a Boolean telling whether a flip occurred are returned.
finalize_extended: (Param,mat->ParamPol): conversion for extended parameters
  Like scale_extended, this function is about tracking flips in the default
  choice of extended representation, this time for the operation of expanding a
  parameter in terms of parameters that have no singular descents that occurs
  implicitly when they enter into a ParamPol. When interpreting the parameter as
  specifying a delta-extended representation, the process is somewhat modified
  and flips may be encountered. This function applied to (p,delta) requires p to
  be delta-fixed; if it finds a singular descent, it replaces p by the sum of
  the parameters descended from it in the extended block, and when there is a
  "sign flip" along the edge used, the resulting parameter is multiplied by s.
  And this is repeated recursively as long as singular descents are present.

raw_KL: (Block->mat,[vec],vec): Kazhdan-Lusztig data for block, raw form
  The call raw_KL(b) produces a matrix of numbers identifying polynomials, a
  list of those polynomials in the form of coefficient vectors, and a sequence
  'stops' of length boundaries that allow deducing the "lengths" of the integers
  used to index the matrix. The matrix is indexed by integers identifying block
  elements for the block, and the matrix entries are indices into the list of
  polynomials; in the final vector stops[l] is the first block element of length
  (at least) l. So if (M,L,len)=raw_KL(b), and v,w are integers identifying
  block elements, then the vector L[M[v,w]] gives the coefficients of the KL
  polynomial P_{v,w}. The length of (the block element number) v is the largest
  index l such that stops[l]<=v, and therefore one can find the length
  difference between v and w as the number of indices l with v<stops[l]<=w.

dual_KL: (Block->mat,[vec],vec): dual KL polynomials (Q_{x,y}) for block
  This is like raw_KL, but computes the polynomials Q instead of P. The
  indexing of the block is the same as for the polynomials P, so up to length
  signs, the matrix should be the inverse of the P matrix. The length stops
  are provided as final value, as in raw_KL; these are for the _same_ block.

raw_ext_KL: (Param,mat->mat,[vec],vec): extended Kazhdan-Lusztig data
  This function takes input similar to extended_block, namely a parameter and
  the matrix of a distinguished involution, which should commute with the
  distinguished involution defining the inner class, and produces raw output
  describing the extended Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials associated to the block
  for the extended group, in a format similar to that used in raw_KL. So the
  matrix is indexed by block elements and its entries describe polynomials by an
  identification number, used as index into a list of polynomials that is the
  second component returned. In contrast to raw_KL, negative entries may occur
  in the matrix, which means that the polynomial found at its absolute value
  should by multiplied by -1 (the polynomial at index 0 is always the zero
  polynomial, so there is no need to negate it). The third component specifies
  at position l the block element for which the length function (which is
  monotonically increasing along the block), takes a value at least l for the
  first time.

W_graph: (Block->[[int],[int,int]]): data describing W-graph for this block
  The data consists of a list with for each element x of the block a pair,
  consisting of its \tau-invariant (as list of 0-based simple root indices),
  and a list of outgoing edges, each one as a pair of a destination vertex y
  and the integer \mu(x,y) that labels to this edge in the W-graph.
W_cells: (Block->[[int],[[int],[int,int]]])): data describing W-cells for block
  This decomposes the W-graph into cells, and returns data describing each of
  those cells. It consists of a list with for each cell a pair consisting of
  a list of numbers identifying the elements of this cell by the numbers of
  the block elements the correspond to, and the structure of the restriction
  of the W-graph restricted to this block, in the same format as W_graph above.

extended_KL_block: (Param,mat->[Param],mat,vec): extended KL data for deform
  This function computes twisted KLV polynomials for (part of) a block, in the
  spirit of KL_block, but presents its data in a somewhat more "cooked" form.
  The arguments (p,delta) are a parameter and a distinguished involution as for
  raw_ext_KL. The list of parameters returned are the delta-fixed parameters of
  the block, which therefore give elements of the extended block, but those that
  have a singular descent among the simple generators of the extended block are
  removed from the list. The list is also truncated by removing any elements
  that are beyond p from it, so if present p is the final element on the list.
  The matrix of KL polynomials is condensed to a square matrix index by just the
  listed elements, a mapping as described in KL_block having been applied.
  Moreover, since the deformation algorithm can work with just the evaluations
  of the P polynomials at q=-1, these evaluations are computed (so that the
  result can be returned as a plain matrix, the second component) and the
  resulting number is negated for those entries for which the length difference
  for the block elements for its row and column is odd. The final component is a
  vector whose entries are the lengths of the parameters in the block. The form
  of the result is meant to be directly usable in the deformation algorithm.

print_gradings: (CartanClass,RealForm->): print gradings defined by real form
  This more or less gives the output of the 'gradings' command in Fokko, for the
  selected real form. The type of the imaginary root system is printed, with the
  numbers of the roots that span this root subsystem as simple roots, in the
  Bourbaki ordering for its type. Then for each element in the list produced by
  fiber_part for the same arguments, the grading of the imaginary root system is
  given as a sequence of bits 0 (compact) or 1 (non-compact), to be interpreted
  on the simple roots in the given order, and extended to the whole imaginary
  root subsystem as a Z/2Z grading.
