{This is meant to be functions for computing all unitary reps with
fixed LKT (x,lambda) and infl char in the FPP. Functions are meant to
use a Param_has Uhash containing a list of known unitary reps (like
Arthur's special unipotent ones) in order to avoid doing difficult
is_unitary calculations.

Throughout, the VertexData vd is meant to be the list of all vertices
in the FPP (that are fixed by the distinguished involution), and a
lookup function.

Attached to theta = x.involution and dlambda are

Perm = vec (size = number of vertices of FPP)
{mapAct = vec (size = number of vertices of FPP)}
Lvd = VertexData (vertex infinitesimal chars v in the FPP of Params
		 (x, lambda v))

Here Perm is a partially defined permutation of order two of (indices
for) vd.list: it can happen that

- Perm[i] = i (fixed vertex v_i, so (x,lambda,v_i) is a Param of infl char
v_i); or

- Perm[j] = k != j, and Perm[k] = j, so (x,lambda, (v_j+v_k)/2) is a Param
  of infl char (v_j + v_k)/2; or

- Perm[ell] = -1, in which case v_ell has nothing to do with FPP Params
  at (x,lambda)

Say there are P fixed i and Q pairs (j,k). Then Lvd.list is the P+Q
vertices v_i and (v_j+v_k)/2, numbered in some way (probably not
reasonable).

{mapAct is a partially defined map from the indices for vd.list to the
indices for Lvd.list.

If Perm[i] = i, then mapAct[i] = index of v_i in Lvd.list

If Perm[j] = k != j, then mapAct[j] = mapAct[k] = mapAct[j] =
number of (v_j+v_k)/2 in Lvd.list

For other ell, mapAct[ell] = -1.}

Suppose (a_0,...,a_d) are the vertex numbers (indices in vd.list) of a d-diml face of the
FPP. Then this face meets FPP Params at (x,lambda) if and only if
(a_0,...,a_d) consists of p entries with Perm[a_i] = a_i and 2q
entries (a_j, a_k) exchanged by Perm (and no -1 entries). In this case
our face meets the FPP infl chars in a face of dimension p+q-1, with
vertices the fixed a_i and the various (a_j+a_k)/2.

The function localFD_Lvd(x, lambda, vd) computes (Lvd, Perm{, mapAct}).

Each d-dimensional (local) face at (x,lambda) is referred to by the
vec of its d+1 indices in Lvd.list. Appended to the end of this vec is
a single integer giving the location of the K_character of the local
face in a KTypePol_hash pol_hash.

There are four main functions, each taking either a long argument

(x, lambda, vd, LVD, Perm{, mapAct}, pol_hash, Uhash)

if you already have these in hand, or a short argument

(x, lambda, Uhash).

Functions each produce a list of all Params (x, lambda, nu_j), each
the barycenter of its local face, each having weakly dominant
infinitesimal character in the FPP (but possibly not final), and each
having all Langlands quotients unitary. These unitary reps are also
added to Uhash.

Here is a description of the four algorithms between these.

*******************
local_test_GEO_hash_dumb

This finds all vertices, then all edges, and computes the graph; then
removes all nonunitary vertices and edges.

For each face dimension D+1 after that, it finds all D+1-diml faces
having unitary-to-hts[D] faces; then makes a directed graph, and
eliminates all nonunitary faces.

The version def_dumb (invoked by def_flag = true, which is the
default) does unitarity tests using is_unitary_def_test.
*******************
local_test_GEO_hash
This finds all unitary-to-hts[0] vertices, then all unitary-to-hts[0]
edges.

For each face dimension D+1 after that, it finds all D+1-diml faces
having unitary-to-hts[D] faces; then makes a directed graph, and
eliminates all faces failing is-unitary-to-hts[D].

Now it has all faces of all dimensions passing is-unitary-to-hts[top
dim -1]. From these it makes a graph, and computes is_unitary.
*******************
local_test_GEO_hash2

Finds ALL vertices, then ALL edges; then makes a graph, and discards
all vertices and edges failing is_unitary_to_hts[0].

Rest is same as local_test_GEO_hash. This version seems faster because
use of the graph up to dimension 1 reduces the number of
is_unitary_to_hts[0] tests.
********************
local_test_GEO_hash_one_level

Assesses the "difficulty" of this case. If it's relatively easy,
reverts to local_test_GEO_hash2. Otherwise...

Finds ALL vertices, then ALL edges; then makes a graph, and discards
all vertices and edges failing is_unitary_to_hts[0, 1, ... ,
one_level].

For each face dimension D+1 after that, it finds all D+1-diml faces
having unitary-to-hts[one_level] faces; then makes a directed graph, and
eliminates all D+!-diml faces failing is-unitary-to-hts[one_level].

Now it has all faces of all dimensions passing
is-unitary-to-hts[one_level]. From these it makes a graph, and
computes is_unitary using is_unitary_test([one_level+1,...,last_level])
