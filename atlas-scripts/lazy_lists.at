{ One may for innstance define, to get an infinite list of entries 1:

  set rec_fun ones () = inf_node: (1,ones)

  and then refer to it as |ones@void|, since |set| stores this function in the
  overload table. The following defines a variable instead, by avoiding |set|
}

{ get initial |n| terms of the list, and return them as ordinary list }

  (inf_list f) [int]: for :n do let (head,tail)=f() in head next f:=tail od


set rec_fun extend_0 ([int] pol) = inf_list:
  @: (if =#pol then 0 else pol[0] fi,extend_0(pol[1:]))

{ drop |n| initial terms, and return remaining infinite list }
set shift (int n) = (inf_list->inf_list):
  (inf_list L) inf_list: for :n do set(,L):=L() od; L

{ more general then |ones|, we can define aritmetic and geometric progressions }
set arithmetic_progression (int stride) = rec_fun f (int start) inf_list:
  @: (start,f(start+stride))

set geometric_progression (int lambda) = rec_fun f (int start) inf_list:
  @: (start,f(start*lambda))

{ it can be important, especially in recursive definitions, to avoid evaluating
  the thunk defining an infinite list mora than once, but instead store the
  values that have already been computed. The function |memoize| adds the
  necessary storage on top of an infinite list: before actually calling the
  thunk, it defines a variable that can store the node produced, but initially
  stores nothing. The first time the memoized function is called, the thunk is
  called and the result stored, from which further calls will retrieve it. The
  magic comes from applying |memoize| recursively to the tail, before storage.

{ Using |memoize| remains delicate, since it is most useful in recursion, but
  the |rec_fun| syntax does not allow anything coming before the arguments, as
  |rec_fun signs = inf_list: memoize(@:(1,@:(-1,signs)))| (NOT SYNTACTIC)
  while calling |memoize| inside the function body creates separate memo tables
  each time a call is done (even if it has the same arguments). The solution is
  to tie the recursive knot by hand, rather than have |rec_fun| do it for us.

{ the Fibonacci sequence can be defined |divide_by([1,-1,-1],extend_0([0,1]))|,
  however we now show how it can be defined in a directly recursive fashion }
set fibonacci = inf_list:
  let fibo () = inf_node:die { stub, which next |memoize| doesn't call yet }
  in fibo := memoize(@:(0,@:(1,sum(fibo,shift(1)(fibo)))))
{ Note that leaving out |memoize| would be possible here, but makes the runtime
  increase exponentially with the list length because of repeated evaluations of
  the same list elements. That inefficient version would also be obtained by
  | set rec_fun fibonacci () = inf_node:(0,@:(1,sum(fibo,shift(1)(fibo))))) |
