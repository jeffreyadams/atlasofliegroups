{ The purpose of this file is working with Weyl group characters }

{ A first task is to list the $W$ conjugacy classes.

  Every Weyl group element $w$ has an associated Levi subgroup (not necessarily
  standard), whose roots are those whose reflections fix all weights fixed by
  $w$ (its eigenspace for $1$ in the reflection representation). Then $w$ is in
  the Weyl group of this Levi subgroup, and by construction is elliptic there.

  The Weyl subgroup of any Levi subgroup is conjugate in $W$ to that of a
  standard Levi subgroup, so for the purpose of finding the conjugacy classes of
  $W$ it suffices to consider only standard Levi subgroups. A first task is to
  classify standard Levi subgroups (determined by subsets of the simple roots)
  by conjugacy. It turns out that Levi subsystems (whether or not standard) are
  conjugate in $W$ if and only if their sum-of-posroots ($2\rho$) are conjugate.

  So compute $2\rho$ values for standard Levi subsystems, use |dominant| to
  decide $W$-conjugacy, and classify all subsets of the set of simple roots
  (from |power_set| in basic.at) by conjugacy of their associated $2\rho$s.

{ Intermezzo: some transformations of presentation of a Levi system

  A Levi system, not necessarily standard, can be defined either by the roots
  forming a simple system for it (represented by their indices, usually within
  |posroots(rd)|, tough the code can handle negative indices of negative roots),
  or by a predicate selecting the indices of positive roots in the system.

  The function |Levi_info| deduces the predicate from the simple system, or from
  a Weyl group element $w$ (selecting coroots vanishing on $w$-fixed weights),
  and |Levi_datum| builds the root datum for the subsystem, given the predicate.

{
  From $w$ we find the associated non-standard Levi subsystem, the minimal one
  in whose Weyl group $w$ occurs. Our next task, surprisingly difficult, is to
  find a standard Levi system conjugate to it, and a conjugating element of $W$.

  For the case where the Levi subsystem contains all roots but is given a non
  standard set of simple generators (not all positive), there is an easy
  algorithm to find $w$ that maps the simple roots of |rd| to those generators,
  namely as long as the system contains a negative root, select one (recording
  it position) and apply the corresponding (non simple) root reflection to all
  roots; when all roots have become positive, we should have a permutation of
  the simple roots, and we can take as letters of $w$ from right to left, for
  each reflection applied the simple generator that ended up at the recorded
  position.

  Our approach is then to extend the Levi system one root at a time to a maximal
  system, and then apply this algorithm. To find a root by which we can extend
  the Levi system to a larger one, we first locate using |minima_extenders| a
  set of candidates (root indices, not necessaril positive ones), whose roots
  are minimally positive for some some linear form vanishing on |Levi|. From
  these, |extend_Levi| will then select a minimal one for |Levi| root addition.

{ A third task is to test for conjugacy in $W$.

  The above allows us to conjugate any $w$ a Weyl group element to one that is
  elliptic (up to a torus part) for a standard Levi system. However, although we
  can test conjugacy of standard Levi systems, we currently have no method
  producing a witness, so we cannot yet reduce to the conjugacy problem of
  elliptic elements in the Weyl group of a standard Levi subgroup.

  Therefore, we use for the moment a method that basically compares
  characteristic polynomials, but adds a special test to discriminate between
  two classes of elliptic elements for F4 that share a characteristic polynomial
  (an outer automorphism switches them). This method does not work when the
  implied Levi subsystem is composite and contains a factor F4.

{ The next task is to determine the order of a conjugacy class of |w| without
  enumerating it, computing using some basic group theory. Since we shall reduce
  to a minimal (non standard) Levi subsystem in whose Weyl group |w| lives, we
  can compute the order of its centralizer in that Weyl group, where it is
  elliptic. This will allow computing the order of the conjugacy class in the
  Levi Weyl group, but this needs to be multiplied by the number of Levi systems
  conjugate to the one at hand. This is the index in $W$ of the normaliser $N_L$
  of the Levi system, but we cannot find the size of $N_L$ without some amount
  of explicit enumeration. We first do a direct approach, then an improvement.

  The function |Levi_orbit| generates the orbit under $W$ of a Levi subsystem,
  represented by the indices of the positive roots forming its simple
  generators. It uses the fact that simple reflections have an easy action on
  such sets of postive roots: either the set contains the simple root for the
  applied reflection, in which case the Levi system is unchanged so no new orbit
  element is produced, or else one just reflects each of the generators for the
  Levi system, which remain positive. One does need to sort the result in order
  to have a unique representation of each simple system, for equality testing.

{ Computing just the size of this Levi orbit can be done a bit more efficiently
  than generating it, though it requires a some preliminary computation. The
  idea is to use the stabiliser subgroup $M$ in $W$ of $\rho_L$; though it does
  not contain $N_L$, the intersection $M\cap N_L$ has known index in $N_L$,
  namely the size of $W_L$ (every coset by $W_L$ meets the intersection
  uniquely). So we generate the (hopefully small) orbit under $M$ of images of
  the Levi system, then by dividing the size of $M$ by that of the orbit find
  the size of the intersection, which multiplied by that of $W_L$ gives the size
  of $N_L$, and dividing the size of $W$ by that gives our Levi orbit size.

  The orbit generation here is taylored to the specific situation, whence we do
  it using local code (the |begin|-|end| block below) rather than writing or
  using a more general orbit generation. The special circumstance is that we
  know that all elements of the acting subgroup fix $\rho_L$, so the only way
  they can map all simple generators of $L$ to roots of $L$ is by permuting them
  among each other. We can then ignore the distinction between a root and its
  opposite (working only with positive root indices) and not worry about
  choosing the simple generators for the positive part of each Levi system
  (which is why we had to single out the "do nothing" case above): the Levi
  system implied by a set of indices is the one additively generated by those
  roots and their opposites, and this results in the same system only if the
  indices are the same up to permutation. So again we can use an equality test
  for orbit membership, provided we sort our lists of indices to be increasing.
