Marc's suggestion to change "skew-adjoint" to "anti-self-adjoint" in
the abstract: Google gives 22,900 hits for

"skew-adjoint" mathematics

and 13,100 hits for

"anti-self-adjoint" mathematics

I take this as reason enough not to change the abstract, but am
willing to be outvoted.
*********************************
I hate the font that they use for \mathcal (see page 1) but I suppose
it's mathematically harmless?
*********************************
Third complete paragraph on page 3: breaking the equation t=0 is bad;
should be entirely on the second line.
*********************************
There are a few places in the manuscript that use the LaTeX code

   \cites{ref1,ref2}

These are not typeset correctly; the result is meant to be

   [number for ref1, number for ref2]

First occurrence is on page 3; there are two on page 135, and one on the
bottom of page 156.
*********************************
Since you have changed the names of the sections to "Chapter," all the
references to "Section xx" need to be changed to "Chapter xx." This
can be done with search and replace "Section" by "Chapter":

page 4, in paragraphs 4 and 5
page 5, paragraph 1 Sec 3
page 6, paragraph 2 Sec 3
page 8, two paragraphs from bottom Sec 6
page 34, end of 1st paragraph  Sec 9
page 38 top Sec 8
page 38 bottom Sec 15
page 48 1st paragraph Sec 15
page 57 top Secs 18 19

page 119 bottom Sec 20
page 128 bottom Sec 19

page 142: first occurrence of "Section" that should NOT be replaced
by "Chapter"

page 168 middle Sec 21
*********************************
Since you have changed the names of the sections to "Chapter," all the
references to "this section" need to be changed to "this chapter"
Can be done by search-and-replace "this section" by "this chapter" and
"present section" by "present chapter" and "next section" by "next chapter"
and "few sections" by "few chapters"

don't change "intersection"

page 11, proof of Theorem 2.7: replace "Part 1." by "Part (1)"

replace "Part 5." by "Part (5)"

page 11: add missing period after "[13, Theorem 9]." at end of proof
of Theorem 2.7
*********************************
On page 26, Definition 5.10, you appear to have tried to move the main
display inline. The result is too garbled for me to interpret at
all. Here is the submitted TeX code for the formula:

level one (that is, the central element $-1$ acts by $-1$) function
$$D(\widetilde{h}) = \rho_{\abs}(\widetilde{h})\cdot \left(\prod_{\alpha \in
  R_{\mathbb R}^+} |1 - \alpha(h)^{-1}|\right)\left(\prod_{\beta\in R^+
 - R^+_{\mathbb R}}(1-\beta(h)^{-1})\right).$$
(Here $h\in H$ is the image of $\widetilde{h}$ under the covering map.)

Setting this formula inline appears to us to be a bad idea, but if you
insist, please carefully check the result against our submitted pdf file.
*********************************
Page 34, line 6: remove a space after "tr(\pi(g)) on G" and before the period.
*********************************
page 35, line 11: subscript is "disc" (not disk): it is an
abbreviation of "discrete"
*********************************
page 40, statement 2 of Theorem 7.1: last formula should be

$J_{L_{\im}}((\Lambda,\nu_{\re}))$

That is, replace subscript "im" by "re".
*********************************
page 49, lines 10-11: again it appears that you tried to put a
displayed equation inline, and the result is unrecognizably
garbled. Corrected LaTeX code is

  We abuse notation by writing $\delta$ for the distinguished
  generator $\delta_1$, so that
  $${}^\delta L({\mathbb C}) = L({\mathbb C})\{e,\delta,
  \delta^2,\dots,\delta^{m-1}\},$$
  a union of $m$ cosets of $L({\mathbb C})$.

(This is slightly amended for clarity from what was submitted.)
*********************************
page 56, Theorem 9.4. The opening has been badly garbled; it should
read

These could be moved to immediately before the displayed equation that
follows.)

References kl79 and kl80 have been eliminated from the bibliography,
presumably because of the failure to read their citations with \cites.

Same for Yee and Yee-new
*********************************
Every occurrence of David Vogan in the bibliography (about six) has been
incorrectly set as "J. D. A. Vogan;" should be "D. A. Vogan, Jr." A
particularly terrible occurrence is in the Langlands reference now
numbered 26.

Reference to Knapp, "Lie groups beyond..." has an extra "ed."
