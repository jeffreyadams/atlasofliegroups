Abstract (jda)

An important tool is a variant of Weyl's...

or some other wording, this isn't exactly Weyl's unitary trick

I suggest the following rewording is both a bit shorter and easier to read:

The first step in Gelfand's program is therefore to find a nice
Hilbert space ${\mathcal H}$ (often of functions on $X$) on which $G$
acts by unitary operators:
\begin{equation*} \pi\colon G \rightarrow U({\mathcal H}). \end{equation*}
For example, if $G$ preserves a measure on $X$, one can take
\begin{equation*} {\mathcal H} =L^2(X) \end{equation*}
Such a group homomorphism~$\pi$ (assumed to be continuous...

Even though it is only about analogues, the fact that different types of
objects (eigenvectors and the line they span) are confused irks me a bit.
I've tried to reword in a manner that avoids this wihout being too formal.
Note that I dropped mention of eigenspaces, lest in the analogue I should have
to mention isotypical components (is that the term?). I leave it to the
nitpickers (is anybody going to outdo me?) to complain that the emphisised
portion should really be irreducible unitary sub-representation (with or without
the dash); while precise that would be unnecessarily distracting.

One of the most powerful tools of linear algebra is the theory of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which allow some problems about linear
transformations of a complex vector space to be understood by decomposing
the space as a direct sum of one-dimensional invariant subspaces, in each of
which the transformation is just multiplication by a complex number. These
one-dimensional subspaces preserved by the linear transformation are those
spanned by an eigenvector of the transformation, and the associated complex
number its eigenvalue. In unitary representation
theory the analogue of such a one-dimensional space is an
{\em irreducible unitary representation}: a nonzero unitary representation
having no proper closed subspaces invariant under~$\pi(G)$. Just as a
finite-dimensional complex vector space equipped with a (nice enough)
linear transformation is a direct sum of subspaces spanned by eigenvectors,
so any (nice enough) unitary representation is something like a direct sum
of irreducible unitary sub-representations.

Marc's suggestion to change "skew-adjoint" to "anti-self-adjoint" in
the abstract: Google gives 22,900 hits for

"skew-adjoint" mathematics

and 13,100 hits for

"anti-self-adjoint" mathematics

I take this as reason enough not to change the abstract, but am
willing to be outvoted.

I hate the font that they use for \mathcal (see page 1) but I suppose

There are a few places in the manuscript that use the LaTeX code

bottom of page 156.

Since you have changed the names of the sections to "Chapter," all the

can be done with search and replace "Section" by "Chapter":

According to standard references the semicolon goes outside the quote.
This also occurs twice on page 11 and on page 15

The rule depends on the punctuation: commas and periods inside,
colons, semicolons and dashes outside.

On page 154: "unitary trick:"

I don't know if we want to bring this up, but in the body of the paper
commas go inside (correct), but in the references they are on the
outside (wrong). Maybe the rules are different for references.

I think it would be nice (but not essential) to add this reference
for Theorem 3.2:

{\it Duke Math. J.} 167 (2018), no. 6, 1057â€“1097.
*********************************
page 15, line 1 (jda)

It is Adams's humble opinion that the correct punctuation is
"Langlands's classification". But both versions are considered correct
so I don't insist.

(dav) Google popularity contest: "Langlands' classification" gets 8000 hits,
and "Langlands's classification" gets 14 (several from Knapp, which
fits with the attitude implicit in Jeff's comment). I think that the
extra (sorry, the _required_) "s" is a stumbling block in reading the
phrase.

Lemma 5.6 item 1 is somewhat out of place, and I'm not sure epsilon
actually gets used anywhere (\epsilon_{iR} appears in Lemma 5.9). But
probably just leave it.

Suppose G(C) is a complex ... (insert "a")
*********************************
On page 26, Definition 5.10, you appear to have tried to move the main
display inline. The result is too garbled for me to interpret at
all. Here is the submitted TeX code for the formula:

level one (that is, the central element $-1$ acts by $-1$) function
$$D(\widetilde{h}) = \rho_{\abs}(\widetilde{h})\cdot \left(\prod_{\alpha \in
  R_{\mathbb R}^+} |1 - \alpha(h)^{-1}|\right)\left(\prod_{\beta\in R^+
 - R^+_{\mathbb R}}(1-\beta(h)^{-1})\right).$$
(Here $h\in H$ is the image of $\widetilde{h}$ under the covering map.)

Setting this formula inline appears to us to be a bad idea, but if you
insist, please carefully check the result against our submitted pdf file.
*********************************
Page 28 (jda)

line 12: is equal on \tilde H...  "on" should be in italics

(dav) actually that was the way it was written: emphasizing the phrase
"on H~^+_reg" since the formula does {\em not} hold hold on the whole
regular set.

next displayed formula (for \Theta_\pi): unmatched large left
parentheses

(dav) ??? I don't see it.

sentence after this formula: three occurences of "level *" with quotes. I think
the first one should be in quotes, but the latter 2 should not.
*********************************
page 32 (jda)

Theorem 6.1 2. is a level one... (insert "a")

last line: "...is the alternating sum of these functors". Maybe saying
"functors" here is a little odd, we mean alternating sum of the
functors applied to something. Maybe simply "...is the corresponding
alternating sum".

last line: should there be parentheses (or brackets?) around the argument?
Same question on page 34, second displayed formula

line 1: "conjugate by G". Is it necessary to say anything about the fact the
we're acting on (characters of) a covering group?

line 10: disc not disk

line 15: If \Lambda is a discrete parmeter and nu is a continuous
parameter for \Lambda, then (\Lambda,\nu) is a Langlands parameter,
and things like I(\Lambda,\nu) are defined. For example see
Proposition 6.6 2. Maybe this is obvious, but I think we should say
something to indicate what the notation I(Lambda,nu) means.

I hate the caligraphic L.

That is, replace subscript "im" by "re".
*********************************
page 49, lines 10-11: again it appears that you tried to put a
displayed equation inline, and the result is unrecognizably
garbled. Corrected LaTeX code is

  We abuse notation by writing $\delta$ for the distinguished
  generator $\delta_1$, so that
  $${}^\delta L({\mathbb C}) = L({\mathbb C})\{e,\delta,
  \delta^2,\dots,\delta^{m-1}\},$$
  a union of $m$ cosets of $L({\mathbb C})$.

I'm really mystified why we write "VZ" stands for "Zuckerman".  Maybe
there are two Zuckermans, Gregg and Victor? Or these are virtual in

"Vogan-Zuckerman".

Proposition 12.6, 5, right hand side J\oplus J^\theta.

The LHS is a representation of the extended group, the RHS is
unextended. Is this equality meant as a vector space? Or it should say
"restricted to (\g,K)" somewhere? Similarly in part 6, and Proposition
12.7 part 4.
*****************************
page 90 (jda)

First line of plain text: "... for the connected group". Maybe this is
being too picky, but G (or K) aren't necessarily connected, so
"connected" here means "case of the real points of a connected group".
Maybe just drop "for the connected group" (implicit in Theorem 6.1).
