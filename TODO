* Mathematical work to be done
- Study what the unequal rank case is about, and how to do it

* Work on the Atlas library

- Fix lack of edge flipping in first (classical) extended block contructor
- Rewrite block construction using methods inspired by synthetic operations
- Remove code for storing the Hermitian dual in KGB structures and blocks
- Rewrite K type computations to use data type more compatible with Param

* Work on the Fokko program

- correct bug with mysterious typeahead after bailing out with ? (done?)
- Fix bug occurring when switching the real form when coming from realmode
- clean up the mess dealing with input (interface/input, io/interactive...)

* Work on the atlas program

- Improve output of expressions
  Distinguish one-line (maybe abbreviated) and long forms.
  Nuance "simply connected" and "adjoint" for non-semisimple root data

- See if cloning of all value types is needed, and remove unnecessary ones

- Make system test for duplicate objects like two equivalent real forms in the
  same inner class that will test equal; they should be the same object.

- For errors during implict conversion, provide back-tracing as for calls

- Implement operate-and-assign directly. While 'v #:= x' (with vec v, int x)
  is easy to write (and common in loop bodies), it is converted to 'v := v#x'
  which is not efficient: with the operation '#' separated in the syntax tree
  from the assignement ':=', it has no chance of knowing that the same object
  can be used to store the result, even if the pointer accessing it has the
  lowest possible refcount (which is 2, since the name 'v' must be sharing the
  pointer). This could however be made possible if built-in compound
  assignment were handled as a single operation for certain built-in
  operations. Note that this can never be done for user-defined functions, as
  they have no means of indicating how the return value might reuse the memory
  from the argument. The combined operator would be most useful for
  concatenation, but operations on large values, such as vector addition,
  could also profit; indeed also (big) integer arithmetic might used this.

- Extend language with recursive types, as well as disjoint union types.
- Extend type system to deal with second-order types
- Allow encapsulation into user-defined types (possibly using 2nd order types)

- Ensure that root data obtained from inner classes or beyond are shared
- Avoid creating many identical |real_form_value| instances, by storing links
  to those currently generated within an |inner_class_value| object

* Work on the atlas scripts
- Complete the groups in groups.rx (types G,F); also avoid use of "s" etc.
- Adapt scripts to use/illustrate the new language features, once implemented.

* Work on documentation

- Write a tutorial on the axis languge, in bottom-up style

* Work on makefiles, distribution and support programs (cwebx)
- change build process so 'atlas' is ensured to get most recent version string
- change name of parser.y to parser.ypp, and adapt all Makefiles
- Figure out how to avoid 'unrecognised typedefs' all the time
- Make cweavex format a 2-line "do x; while(y);" with correct indentation
- Make cwebx messages mention file name, to 'make -jN' output comprehensible
- Add some make targets for recording options as suggested by Nelson Beebe
