This directory contains a stripped-down version of CWEBx (version 3.6), which
is a tool that is used to process various source files in the Atlas project to
compilable files on one hand, and to program documentation on the other hand.

The CWEBx system consists of two executable programs, ctanglex and cweavex.
They are built by running "make" in the current directory. This should
normally be done automatically while building Atlas, and the programs will
then be called automatically under control of the Atlas makefiles.

This directory contains just the derived compilable sources; no orignal source
files, documentation or examples are provided, for which the official cwebx
distribution should be used.

The CWEBX home page is at http://www-math.univ-poitiers.fr/~maavl/CWEBx/ but
may at times be lagging behind the development, for which a git repository is
maintained at https://github.com/marc-van-leeuwen/cwebx

Here is a listing of the files constituting the release with a brief
indication of their purpose. The last two files are needed for processing the
(plain) TeX files produced by cweavex; make sure they are on your TeX input
path (by setting the TEXINPUTS environment variable) in case you want to
produce source documentation for the pertinent Atlas files (these are
currently mostly the ones that define the atlas interpreter).

README	        % the file you are currently reading
Makefile	% control file for POSIX 'make' facility to build CWEB

common.c	% C file for code shared by ctanglex and cweavex
common.h	% C header file for the common code
ctangle.c	% C file for proper code of the ctanglex program
cweave.c	% C file for proper code of the cweavex program

cwebxmac.tex	% TeX macro file needed to process files produced by CWEAVE
cwebhmac.tex	% optional TeX macro file creating hyperlinks for xhdvi (e.g.)
