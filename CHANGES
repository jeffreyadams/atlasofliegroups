Changes to the Atlas of Lie Groups Software

A detailed history of the early development is found in the file
workinglog. Newer changes are documented in the CVS repository.
This file contains a summary of major changes to the software.

Version 0.5   (Jun 1, 2012)
Building atlas and realex:
* 'make readline=false' option for realex

* New atlas commands:
** deform (compute terms of deformation when passing through given parameter)

 Output format of involutions changed in blocku, blockd; also difference nblock

* New realex functions:
** real_form (KGBElt), % (KGBElt), =(KGBElt, KGBElt), torus_bits, torus_factor
** param, % (Param), is_standard, is_zero, is_final, real_form (Param)
** infinitesimal_character, orientation_nr, = (Param,Param), dominant
** print_nblock, n_block, reducibility_points, KL_block
** +, -, * (Split,Split), % (Split)
** null_module, # (ParamPol), + (ParamPol, ), * (Split,ParamPol), % (ParamPol)
** deform (Param)

* New realex scripts:
** iterate_deform.rx, misc.rx, kl.rx, hermitian.rx, translate.rx
** test.rx, unitary.rx
** groups.rx changed and extended (things like GL(3,C), Sp(4,R) allowed)

* New realex features:
** Implicit conversions vec->ratvec, [int]->ratvec, int->Split, Param->ParamPol
** ratvec values are always in lowest terms
** Allow empty patterns in let: let a=3*7 then ()=prints("a=",a) then .. in ..
** Improved feedback during file inclusion and improved error reporting
** File inclusion more resistant against various kinds of errorsXS

Version 0.4.6 (Nov 17, 2011)
* New atlas commands:
** kgp, kgporder (like kgb, kgborder, but for parabolic P instaead of B)
** partial_block (undocumented; compute only lower interval of block)

Version 0.4.5 (Jul 20, 2011)
* New commands:
** embedding: shows the shifts between subgroup and full group basepoints
** nblock: computes a non-integral block and KL polynomials for given parameter

Version 0.4.4 (Oct 12, 2010)
* Format of block output changed (cartan column moved to penultimate one)
* New commands:
** X (outputs entire space X, union of kgb spaces over all strong real forms)
** qKtypeform, qKtypemat,qbranch: q versions of Ktypeform, Ktypemat, branch
** iblock: construct a (integrality) block with given parameter (x,lambda,nu)
** srtest: gives information about a representation

Version 0.4.3 (Jul 17, 2009)
* Help files for small* commands

Version 0.4.2 (Jun 29, 2009)
* fixed major bug in testrun

Version 0.4.1 (Jun 27, 2009)
* Small bug fixes
* Improved compilability of realex

Version 0.4
* New commands related to K: Ktypeform, Ktypemat, branch, KGB,
trivial, test, sub_KGB, mod_lattice
* Many new help files

Version 0.3.1
* Updated INSTALL file with new readline instructions for the mac
Version 0.3
* Classification of Cartan classes now uses canonical representatives
* Added 'kgborder' and 'blockorder' commands
* Added 'dualkgb', 'dualblock', and 'dualmap' commands
* Added experimental commands 'smallkgb', 'smallblock', and smalldual variants
* Significant speed-up of K\G/B and block constructions
* Added a block mode on top of real mode
* Computed block and K-L data is persistent until leaving block mode
* Several subtle bugs (only rarely affecting results) were removed, notably
  one causing wrong 'blocku' output in some unequal rank inner classes
* Several changes to output format, including:
  - inclusion of canonical representative in Cartan output
  - addition of Cartan class infomation to K\G/B and block output
  - double-valued Cayley transforms are always ordered increasingly
  - addition of inverse Cayley transforms to block output
  - distinction between cross and Cayley in involution-reduced expressions
  - K-L output now makes reference to the Bruhat order

Version 0.2.6.2
* Fixed bug in wcells command
Version 0.2.6.1
* Added make compilable to sources/interpreter
* Fixed Makefile in sources/interpreter so cwebx really isn't needed
Version 0.2.6
* More complete realex command line interpreter
* New method of tracking compile date
Version 0.2.5.1
* New README and INSTALL files
* fixed gcc 4.0.3 bug
* includes realex command line interpreter
* output of Weyl words now includes commas
Version 0.2.5:
* Modified makefile to produce an executable atlas.exe and make a
symlink to it, so the help system will work when called from any
directory
* Added and updated online documentation, including block, kgb,
checkbasept, blockd, blocku, wgraph, wcells
* Changed extrkl to primkl
* Modified output of kgb and primkl commands
* Fixed bug in printing of real forms for inner class u
* Corrected PRIMES_MAX for RANK_MAX=16 and enabled RANK_MAX=32 on a 32
bit machine
* Added doxygen comments
* Fixed bug in (unused) sources/memory
