Instructions  installation of the Atlas software.
For more information about the software see the README file. 

UNIX (including linux, solaris, and Mac OSX)

SHORT INSTRUCTIONS:

On many systems simply do:

make

and optionally

make install

(for make install you probably need to be root).

This will compile the software in place, leave the executable
atlas.exe in place, and put a link to it in /usr/local/bin.

LONGER VERSION:

The executable file is called atlas.exe. This can be installed
anywhere, for example in /usr/local/atlas. For the help system to work
there must be subdirectory /usr/local/atlas/messages. Then atlas.exe
can be run via a symbolic link, called atlas, which can be anywhere,
typically in /usr/local/bin.

Suppose you download the tgz file to the directory source_dir. When
you gunzip and untar the file (with tar xvfz atlas_version.tgz) you
will have a directory source_dir/atlas. cd to this directory. There is
a makefile in this directory. You have two choices:

1) have the executable stay where it is:

source_dir/atlas/atlas.exe
source_dir/atlas/messages
source_dir/atlas/messages/blockd.help etc.

You can create a symlink to atlas.exe, the default is 

/usr/local/bin/atlas -> source_dir/atlas.exe

You can change the location of this symlink by editing the BINDIR
variable in the makefile. 

2) put the executable somewhere else, for example:

/usr/local/atlas/atlas.exe
/usr/local/atlas/messages
/usr/local/atlas/messages/blockd.help etc.

Again you can create a symlink to atlas.exe, the default is
/usr/local/bin, which in this case gives:

/usr/local/bin/atlas -> /usr/local/atlas/atlas.exe

You can change the location of the executable by editing the
INSTALLDIR variable in the makefile. You can change the location of
the symlink by editing the BINDIR variable in the makefile.

See the instructions in the makefile.

Typically:

In a single-user situation, you might want something like this:
INSTALLDIR := /home/fokko/myatlas
BINDIR     := /home/fokko/bin

In a multi-user situation, you might want this (requires root):
INSTALLDIR := /usr/local/atlas
BINDIR     := /usr/local/bin

After optionally editing INSTALLDIR and BINDIR, give the command:

make

If you get some errors about readline see below, or try:

  make readline=false

to compile without readline.

Some other options are:

  verbose=true 
  debug=true 
  optimize=true 
  profile=true 

We recommend verbose=true, which prints out a very small amount of
information about how far along the process is.

If all goes well, run the command

  make install

This may require root privileges, depending on the locations
of INSTALLDIR and BINDIR. The default is to leave the executable where
it is, and install the symlink in /usr/local/bin.

The command atlas, or ./atlas, will run the program.

Do 

make clean

to start from scratch.

For information using the enhanced command line interpreter realex,
see below.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling with readline

readline allows you to recall the previous command with control-p,
does tab-completion of command names, and has other useful command
line features. You should be able to compile with readline on most
linux systems, although in some instance you need to help the compiler
find the proper libraries. For Mac OSX see below.

The variable rlincludes tells the compiler to include certain
libraries needed for readline. The default is 

rlincludes = -lreadline -lcurses

Another possibility is to replace -lcurses with -lncurses.

If you can't get it to compile with readline, use

make readline=false

to compile without this feature.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling with readline on a Mac (contributed by David Vogan)

Get readline-5.2.tar.gz, for example from

ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-5.2.tar.gz

Mac automatically unzips.  Put file readline-5.2.tar someplace
convenient.  In a terminal window, go to the directory with this tar
file, and type

  tar -xvf readline-5.2.tar

This will create a new subdirectory "readline-5.2."  Do a cd to that
directory.

There appears to be a small problem with the "configure" script when
it is used with OS 10.4. To work around it, edit the file

readline-5.2/support/shobj-conf

Line 170 should be changed from

SHOBJ_LDFLAGS='-dynamic'

to

SHOBJ_LDFLAGS='-dynamiclib'

Back in the readline-5.2 directory, type

  ./configure

Type 
  
  make everything

Type

  sudo make install

The Gnu readline library should now be installed on your Mac.

There is a problem when the atlas software is linked: the linker
will find most of the readline commands in someplace like

/usr/lib/libreadline.dylib,

instead of in the Gnu readline library that you just installed, which
lives at

/usr/local/lib/libreadline.5.dylib

The difficulty is that the Mac library lacks two or three of the
commands used in the atlas readline, so the linker will refuse to
finish.  I don't know the best or most natural way to fix this.  One
thing which works is to edit the atlas makefile, modifying the line

        rlincludes := -lreadline -lcurses

to read

        rlincludes := -lreadline.5 -lcurses

Now the atlas software should link.

Using the interpreter (unix only)

There is an early version of an improved command line interface,
called realex. This is called realex, and is by Marc van Leeuwen,
Marc.van-Leeuwen@math.univ-poitiers.fr. To compile it give the command

make realex

The executable file is sources/interpreter/realex, and there are a
number of help files sources/interpreter/*dvi.

If you have trouble at the linking step the problem is probably
readline/curses/ncurses. See sources/interpreter/Makefile.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
WINDOWS

1) Download the distribution atlasWindows.zip to your windows
machine. 

2) Right click on the file to extract the archive.

3) Double click on the atlas file to execute.

When you extract the file you create a folder. This contains the
executable atlas.exe. It also contains three necessary dll files. You
must run the executable from a folder containing these files.
