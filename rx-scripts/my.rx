{ this file is just a suggestion for a possible personal start-up file }

{ load the files you want: }
<lietypes.rx
<groups.rx { this also loads basic.rx }

{ loading hermitian.rx, which recursively also loads misc,iterate_deform,kl }
{<hermitian.rx}

{<unitary.rx {some unitary parameters}}

{ you could also load translate.rx, but it's not necessary for the code below }
{<translate.rx}
