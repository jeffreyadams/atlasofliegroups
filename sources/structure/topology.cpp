  Computation of the (dual) component group of real reductive groups

  The calculation of the component group $\pi_0(G(\R))$ of $G(\R)$ is based on
  the following two facts : (a) for $G$ simply connected semisimple, $G(\R)$
  is connected; (b) for $G$ arbitrary, a maximally split torus $T$ of $G(\R)$
  meets all its connected components.

  From (b), we get that $\pi_0(T)$ surjects onto $\pi_0(G(\R))$; we need to
  determine the kernel of this surjection, which is the subgroup of $\pi_0(T)$
  cut out by the identity component of $G(\R)$. Dually we see the dual group
  $dpi0(G(\R))$ as the subgroup of $dpi0(T)$ orthogonal to the mentioned
  kernel. Once we know $dpi0(G(\R))$ we can therefore determine that kernel,
  and get $\pi_0(G(\R))$ as quotient of $\pi_0(T)$ by it. In fact this module
  does not compute $\pi_0(G(\R))$ at all, but just the dual $dpi0(G(\R))$.

  For any covering homomorphism $G~ \to G$, the identity component of $G~(\R)$
  maps onto the identity component of $G(\R)$. Dually, we see that
  $dpi0(G(\R))$ injects into $dpi0(G~(\R))$, and viewing these as subgroups of
  $dpi0(T)$ and $dpi0(T~)$ respectively, we can find $dpi0(G(\R))$ as the
  inverse image of $dpi0(G~(\R))$ under the map $dpi0(T) \to dpi0(T~)$ induced
  by the covering.

  We can apply this to the covering of $G$ by a "simply connected" group $G~$
  (defined as in |RootDatum::isSimplyConnected| as a group whose derived group
  is simply connected) that is moreover a direct product $G~=H\times T_1$,
  with $H$ simply connected semisimple, and $T_1$ a central torus. Then
  $H(\R)$ is connected, by (a). Therefore $\pi_0(G~(\R)) = \pi_0(T_1(\R))$;
  consequently $dpi0(G~(\R))$ identifies with $dpi0(T_1(\R))$, and its image
  in $dpi0(T~)=dpi0(S)\times dpi0(T_1(\R))$, where $S$ a maximally split torus
  in $H(\R)$, is just the second factor.

  Then the inverse image of $dpi0(G~(\R))$ in $dpi0(T)$ we are after is also
  the kernel of the map $dpi0(T) \to dpi0(S)$. But we may take for $H$ the
  simply connected cover of the derived group of $G$; hence we may suppose
  that the weight lattice of $H$ is the weight lattice of the root system of
  $G$ (the set of weights in the $\Q$-span of the roots that are integral for
  the coroots): restriction to the derived group means projecting the weight
  lattice onto the $\Q$-span of the roots, and taking the simply connected
  cover means extending the lattice to all integral weights for the coroots.
  Then the coweight lattice is just the coroot lattice of $G$; it is easy to
  write down the involution of that lattice (this amounts to writing the
  involution on coroot basis), and then to construct the torus $S$ of $H$.

  The upshot is that (1) the central torus $T_1$ of $G$ is irrelevant to the
  question, and (2) it suffices to know the involution for the maximally split
  torus $T$ of $G(\R)$ (in the original coordinates), and the involution for
  the maximally split torus $S$ of $H(\R)$ (in simple weight coordinates).
  The actual computation of components is done by computing an induced map at
  the level of subquotients and then taking its kernel.

/*****************************************************************************

  The calculation of the component group of $G(\R)$ is based on the following
  two facts: (a) the component group is trivial when $G(\C)$ is simply connected
  and semisimple, (b) for arbitrary $G(\R)$, a maximally split torus of it
  meets all its connected components.

  From (b), we can view the component group of $G(\R)$ as a quotient of the
  component group of its maximally split torus $T$ by the subgroup of its
  components that meet the identity component of $G(\R)$. Moreover, the
  knowledge of this subgroup can be pushed forward across a group morphism $f$
  of real reductive groups that is a local homeomorphism, if its induced action
  on the component groups of maximally split tori is understood: the subgroup at
  the destination is just the induced image of the subgroup at the source (since
  paths linking elements of the respective subgroups can be lifted up or pushed
  down through $f$). This applies in particular when $f$ arises from a covering
  morphism of connected complex groups (whose kernel is stable under the Cartan
  involution upstairs, so that a Cartan involution and a real group are defined
  downstairs); note that such $f$ need not be a covering map (of real groups),
  as it may fail to be surjective, but it still is a local homeomorphism. For
  any real reductive group $G(\R)$ we have such $f:\tilde G(\R)\to G(\R)$, where
  $\tilde G(\C)$ is a direct product of a simply connected semisimple complex
  group $H(\C)$ and a central torus $T_1(\C)$, while $\tilde G(\C)\to G(\C)$ is
  a quotient by a finite central subgroup (this is indeed how real reductive
  groups are obtained in Fokko after user interaction). The component group of
  $\tilde G(\R)$ is that of the real torus $T_1(\R)$ (since $H(\R)$ is connected
  by a), and we can then use $f$ to deduce the component group of $G(\R)$.

  In fact we work with dual groups of the component groups $\pi_0(G(\R))$ of
  real groups, the elements of which dual groups are locally constant morphisms
  $G(\R)\to \C^\times$ (since $\pi_0(G(\R))$ are elementary $2$-groups, one
  could use $\{-1,1\}$ in place of $\C^\times$). The relation of the dual
  $\hat\pi_0(\tilde G(\R))$ of $\pi_0(G(\R))$ with the dual component group of
  its maximally split torus, is that the former can be seen as the subgroup of
  the latter, consisting of morphisms that are $1$ on all torus components that
  meet the identity component of $G(\R)$. Once the map induced by $f$ (in the
  opposite direction) on the dual component groups of maximally split tori is
  known, one can take $\hat\pi_0(G(\R))$ to be the inverse image of (the
  subgroup of the dual component group of its maximally split torus that
  corresponds to) $\hat\pi_0(\tilde G(\R))$, the latter being known (by a).

  Here is part of the original comment by Fokko. Apparently the unexplained
  "kernel we are after" he talks about is the inverse image mentioned above.
  That is probabaly just getting ahead of himself, since the final answer is a
  kernel. However, the subgroup whose inverse image is taken (corresponding to
  $\hat\pi_0(\tilde G(\R))$), can be described as the kernel of the restriction
  map from characters of the maximally split torus $\tilde T$ of $\tilde G(\R)$
  to its intersection with the identity component of $\tilde G(\R)$, which in
  the concrete case is just the maximally split torus $S$ of the "semisimple"
  direct factor $H(\R)$ of $\tilde G(\R)$. Applying that restriction after the
  map $\hat\pi_0(T)\to\hat\pi_0(\tilde T)$, we find our inverse image to be
  kernel of the composed map $\hat\pi_0(T)\to\hat\pi_0(S)$, as Fokko states:

      Now let G~ be of the form HxT_1, with H semisimple simply connected, and
      T_1 a central torus. Then H(R) is connected, from (a). Therefore
      pi0(HxT_1) = pi0(T_1); and so dpi0(T~) identifies with dpi0(T_1), and the
      kernel we are after is also the kernel of the map dpi0(T) -> dpi0(S), with
      S maximally split in H. But we may take for H the simply connected cover
      of the derived group of G; hence we may suppose that the weight lattice of
      H is the weight lattice of the root system of G, and its co-weight lattice
      is then the coroot lattice of G. From this it is easy to write down the
      involution (this amounts to writing the involution on coroot basis), and
      then to construct the torus of that group.

      From this functorial description, it is easy to find out what happens to
      the component group under homomorphisms.
