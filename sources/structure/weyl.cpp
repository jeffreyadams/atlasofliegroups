        Chapter 1 -- The WeylGroup::Transducer class

  The |Transducer| is used to implement right multiplication action of simple
  reflections on a Weyl group modulo (to the left) a parabolic subgroup. In the
  cases where right multiplication by |s| stabilises the parabolic coset, a new
  generator |t| is produced (to the left) to represent the commutation with the
  chosen (minimal length coset representative |w|, so $w*s=t*w|. Here |t| is
  always a generator of the parabolic subgroup to the left.

  In the notation from the description of the class WeylGroup, there will be
  one Transducer object for each parabolic subquotient W_{r-1}\\W_r. List the
  shortest length coset representatives for this subquotient as
  x_0,...,x_{N_r-1}. Recall that the simple roots were ordered to guarantee
  that N_r-1 fits in an unsigned char, so each coset representative can be
  indexed by an unsigned char. We wish to compute the product x_i.s_j for j
  between 1 and r. The key theoretical fact about multiplication is that there
  are two mutually exclusive possibilities:

      x_i.s_j = x_{i'}  (some i' ne i)

  OR

      x_i.s_j = s_k.x_i  (some k < r).

  The first possibility is called _transition_ and the second _transduction_.
  (Confusingly Fokko's 1999 paper interchanges these terms at their definition,
  but their usual meaning and the sequel makes clear that this was an error).

  The Transducer has tables to describe the two cases. the first table
  |d_shift| describes the transitions, namely |d_shift[i][j]==i'| in the
  first case; the cases that are transductions can be distinguished from these
  by the fact that |d_shift[i][j]==i|. In these cases, the value |k| emitted
  by the transduction is stored in |d_out[i][j]|, which otherwise contains the
  value |UndefGenerator|

/*
  Construct subquotient \#r for the Coxeter matrix c.

  This uses the Coxeter matrix only up to index r. In fact we can behave as
  if generator |r| is the final one, since we ignore any higher ones for now.

  Precondition : c is a _normalized_ Coxeter matrix (meaning that all
  the parabolic subquotients W_{r-1}\\W_r are small enough to fit in
  an unsigned char); and r is < rank(c);

  Algorithm :

  The algorithm is a version of my [Fokko] favorite bootstrapping procedure
  for the construction of Weyl groups and parabolic quotients. We start with a
  partially defined automaton containing only one element, and for which all
  shifts by the final generator $r$ are not yet defined (generators $i<r$ give
  transduction of $i$). At each point in time, all shifts for all elements in
  the automaton that do _not_ take the length up are defined; and we maintain
  a queue of elements that may have as yet undefined shifts.

  We start up with one element in the automaton, with just one undefined
  shift, the one by r. Then run through the elements $x$ of the automaton in
  order of generation (which will also be in ShortLex order), and for each as
  yet undefined shift of $x$ by $s$ :

    - add a new element $xs$ (this increases the size of the automaton, during
      the loop!). At this point it is sure that this element is really new,
      and that its normal form is obtained by adding $s$ to that of $x$

    - then find all other elements $x'$ already in the automaton and $t$ such
      that $xs==x't$ (so $x't$ gives a non-canonical but reduced expression
      for $xs$). Do this by trying generators $t\neq s$: if $xst$ goes down
      (has the same length as $x$) then $x'==xst$ gives such a case. The trick
      for this is to look at the orbit of x under the dihedral group $\<s,t>$.
      In the full group, this has necessarily cardinality 2m, with m = m(s,t)
      the coefficient in the Coxeter matrix, and $l(xst)==l(x)$ iff $xs$ is
      the unique elt. of maximal length in the orbit, hence to have this $x$
      must goes down $m-1$ times when applying successively $t$, $s$, $t$, ...
      In the parabolic quotient, the orbit of the dihedral group (which is not
      reduced to a point) can either have cardinality $2m$ or cardinality $m$,
      and in the latter case it is a string with $m-1$ steps between the
      bottom and the top, with a stationary step at either extreme (to see
      this, note that on one hand each step up in the full group gives a step
      in the quotient that is either up or stationary, while on the other hand
      a stationary step in the quotient causes then next step to be the
      reverse of the previous one). So we have one of the following three
      cases: (1) $x$ goes down $m-1$ times; then the image of the orbit has
      $2m$ elements and $xs==x't$ for $x'=x.(ts)^(m-1)$. (2) $x$ goes down
      $m-2$ times to some element $a$ and is then stationary (if
      $s'\in\{s,t\}$ is the next to apply, then $a.s'=g.a$ for some generator
      $g\in W_{r-1}$). In case (2) the orbit has $m$ elements, and if $v$ is
      the alternating word in $\{s,t\}$ of length $m-2$ not starting with
      $s'$, so that $a.v=x$, one has $v.st=s'vs$ whence
      $x.st=a.v.st=a.s'vs=g.a.vs=g.xs$ so that $xs$ has a transduction for $t$
      that outputs the generator $g$. (3) either $x$ goes down less than $m-2$
      times, or $m-2$ times followed by an upward step; then $xst$ goes up.

        Chapter 2 -- The WeylGroup and WeylElt classes

  The Weyl group class is a variation on my favourite implementation in terms
  of transducers.

  I have tried to make a careful choice of datatype for the group elements in
  order to strike the right balance between efficiency and generality. This
  has led me to the choice of _fixed size_ arrays of unsigned chars,
  representing the "parabolic subquotient" representation of a given element;
  in other words, in a group of rank n, the first n elements of the array are
  used (but since it is fixed size, we have to allocate it to some constant
  value, namely RANK_MAX.) This is not so wasteful as it may sound : of course
  the representation as a single number is more compact, but will overflow
  even on 64-bit machines for some groups of rank <= 16, and much sooner of
  course on 32-bit machines; also it imposes some computational overhead for
  packing and unpacking. Any variable-size structure like the STL vector uses
  already three pointers for its control structure (the address of the data,
  the size and the capacity), and then it still has to allocate. This could
  perhaps be simplified to just a pointer (after all the size of the
  allocation is known to the group) but you still have the big overhead of
  allocating and deallocating memory from the heap, and remembering to delete
  the pointers when they go out of scope, or else use autopointers ...

  And if worst comes to worst and one really is worried about a factor 2
  waste for type E8 (which might be significant if one deals with huge
  containers of group elements), then one can still recompile with MAX_RANK=8,
  which will then give a datatype that in 64 bits is the same size as an
  unsigned long.

  Notice that the unsigned char type miraculously suffices for all subquotients
  of all groups up to rank 128 (indeed, the biggest subquotient for B128 is
  of order 256), _provided_ the generators are enumerated in an appropriate
  order. This forces us to do quite a bit of type recognition, which is
  relegated to the dynkin namespace. Because of this reordering, the group
  carries a little interface that will translate back and forth from the
  external ordering and the internal one.

  Actually our code now folds the shift and transduce values, which are
  mututally exclusive, into a single table entry of type |unsigned char|. That
  means that the coset size _plus_ the number of distinct values that can be
  output should not exceed 256 for any transducer. The latter number equals the
  number r of the transducer within its Dynkin diagram component (as it can
  output at most r-1); for the final transducer of E8 we get 240+7=247 which
  fits; in classical types the rank limit gets lowered to 86 (the final
  transducer for C86 has 2*86-1=171 states and can output vales 0..84 for
  171+85=256 possible entries. In practice this still is largely sufficent.

/*
  Amazingly, I could simplify Fokko's original to the code below.
  Fokko's original code was (more or less):

  Generator t = s;
  for (Generator j = rank(); j-->0;) {
    if (d_transducer[j].out(w[j],t) == UndefGenerator) {
      // no transduction; shift and terminate
      unsigned long l = d_transducer[j].length(w[j]);
      w[j] = d_transducer[j].shift(w[j],t);
      if (d_transducer[j].length(w[j]) > l)
	return 1;
      else
	return -1;
    }
    else {
      // no shift; transduce and continue
      t = d_transducer[j].out(w[j],t);
    }
  }

  The main simplifications are to avoid calling |d_transducer[j].out| twice in
  succession, and to avoid calling |d_transducer[j].length| at all (since
  comparison of the |EltPiece| values suffices to decide sense of change).

  This simplification led to the following main loop:
  for (Generator t; (t=d_transducer[i].out(w.piece(i),s))!=UndefGenerator; s=t)
  {
    assert(i!=0); // since |d_transducer[0]| only has shifts
    --i;
  }

  I left the test for |UndefGenerator| coming first, as transduce is more
  frequent than shift; hence the following even simpler code could be less
  efficient:

  Generator t=s;
  for (Generator j=rank(); j-->0; t=d_transducer[j].out(w[j],t))
  {
    EltPiece wj=w[j]; w[j]=d_transducer[j].shift(wj,s);
    if (wj!=w[j]) return w[j]>wj ? 1 : -1;

  Note that our transducers are geared towards _right_ multiplication by
  a generator, so this left multiplication is less straightforward.
  Nonetheless there is considerably better than the obvious algorithm of
  starting with a |WeylElt| for the generator |s|, and right-multiplying it
  successively by all letters of a word for |w|. In fact it turns out that
  comparing $w$ with $sw$, only pieces $x_j$ can change for $t <= j <= s$,
  where |t=min_neighbor(s)| is the first generator that does not commute
  with |s|; due to the numbering of diagrams used there are at most 3 such
  $j$, and when there are 3 (for non linear Dynkin diagrams) they occur
  only for small |s|, where the pieces are relatively short. What we are
  claiming is not just that right-multiplying the letters from the words
  for pieces of |w| before |t| all transduce without change across piece |s|
  and doing so reconstruct the same pieces again (this is easy to see), but
  also that when inserting the letters from the pieces $x_j$ that do need to
  be taken into account, only the pieces for the same range of |j| values
  are affected (meaning that none of the |inner_mult| calls invoked by the
  code below will transduce leftwards of piece |t|). Formulated like this it
  is hard to believe at first, but it is easy to prove; for instance, if one
  decomposes the expression for $w$ given by its pieces as $w_1w_2$ where
  $w_1$ is the part in the parabolic factor that commutes with $s$, then
  $sw=sw_1w_2=w_1sw_2$ can only have reductions inside the part $sw_2$,
  leaving the left part $w_1$ unchanged. These observations justify that
  the two loops below only run over the mentioned interval of values |j|.

  Tell whether |w| twisted-commutes with |s|: $s.w.\delta(s)=w$

  Precondition: |w| is a twisted involution: $w^{-1}=\delta(w)$. Therefore
  twisted commutation is equivalent to $s.w$ being a twisted involution.

  This is in fact the case if and only if $s.w.\delta(s)$ has the same
  length as $w$, by the following reasoning. Suppose first that $s.w$ is
  reduced, then its twisted inverse $w.\delta(s)$ is reduced as well. Then
  the only possible reduction in $s.w.\delta(s)$ is cancellation of the
  extremal generators; whether this reduction applies is equivalent to having
  twisted commutation. If $s.w$ is not reduced, then neither is
  $w.\delta(s)$, and $w'=s.w.\delta(s)$ is a twisted involution not
  longer than $w$. If it is strictly shorter then obviously twisted
  commutation fails. In the remaining case that $l(s.w.\delta(s))=l(w)$,
  let $v=s.w$ so that $w=s.v$ and $w'=v.\delta(s)$ are reduced, but
  $w.\delta(s)=s.v.\delta(s)$ does reduce, which can only be by cancelling
  the extremal generators: $s.v.\delta(s)=v$ which implies $w'=w$, and one

  The argument given under |hasTwistedCommutation| shows that for every

  involution distinct from $tw$, and that if $l(s.tw)<l(tw)$ (for the usual
  length function on the Weyl group) then the length of this new twisted
  involution is less than that of $tw$ (by 1 or 2, respectively). A "reduced
  expression as a twisted involution" for $tw$ is obtained by iterating this
  to bring the length down to $0$. Working back from the identity (so reading
  our expression from right to left), it can be determined for each letter to
  which if the two types of transformation it corresponds; nevertheless, we
  encode which case prevails in the sign of the generator recorded: we
  bitwise-complement for the case of conjugation.

  Although not immediately obvious, all such reduced expressions do have the
  same length.

  The code below chooses the first possible generator (for the internal
