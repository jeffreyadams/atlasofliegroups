/*
  The class |Fiber| describes "the fiber" (in the set of strong real forms)
  over a fixed involution of a torus, in twisted Tits group.

  This is an important but somewhat subtle class. In fact none of the data
  stored directly describes the mentioned fiber, or the strong real forms in
  it. There is the description of a "fiber group", a vector space over $Z/2Z$
  that acts simply transitively on the fiber. In other words, the fiber is an
  affine space over $Z/2Z$ with the fiber group as space of translations, and
  a choice of a base point determines a bijection between the fiber and this
  fiber group. One way fiber elements manifest themselves is via a grading of
  the set of imaginary roots. This grading is determined for the entire fiber
  by giving the "base grading" for the base point, and the "grading shifts"
  for translations by each of a set of generators of the grading group.

  We fix an involutive automorphism $\tau$ of the complex torus $H$, and
  consider the collection of all strong involution $x$ of $G$ (which are
  elements of "G semidirect delta") that induce $\tau$ on $H$; conjugation
  defines an action of $H$ on the collection, and strong real forms are
  orbits for this action. A strong real form has square equal to some
  element $z$ in $Z(G)^\delta$. (Changing the element $z$ by $(1+\delta)Z$ is
  relatively innocuous, and the quotient $Z^delta/[(1+delta)Z]$ is finite.)

  For each fixed value of $z$, this collection of strong real forms admits a
  simply transitive action (by left multiplication) of the fiber group: the
  quotient $H^{-\tau}/(1-\tau)H$, which is isomorphic to the component group
  of the complex group $H^{-\tau}$ of fixed points of $-\tau$ on $H$. It is an
  elementary $2$-group that can be realized as a subquotient of the group
  $H(2)$ of involutions in $H$. While the expression $H^{-\tau}/(1-\tau)H$ is
  mathematically correct, it is intuitively misleading since the fiber group
  is largest when $H^{-\tau}$ is smallest, namely when $\tau$ is the identity
  (one simply gets $H(2)$ in this case), and when for the linear involution
  $\theta$ of $X^*$ defined by $\tau$ one has that $-\theta$ has one $0$ as
  fixed point. The expression that will be actually used to determine the
  fiber group is $(X_*)^\theta/(X_*(1+\theta)), the fixed points of $\theta$
  acting on the right on the coweight lattive $X_*$, modulo the image of the
  action of $1+\theta$.

  For a given $z$, orbits of strong real forms for that $z$ under the action
  of the imaginary Weyl group form a partition of the fiber group (which
  partition depends on $z$); this is the basis for the classification of weak
  real forms. These partitions (for various $z$) are stored in |d_strongReal|,
  and accessed by the function |fiber_partition|. A strong real form may be
  labelled by a pair of integers: the second labelling the element $z$ (or
  rather its coset modulo $(1+delta)Z$), and the first the fiber group orbit.

/* Fiber group.

  In terms of the complex torus $H$ and the Cartan involution $\tau$, it
  is equal to $F=H^{-\tau}/(1-\tau)H$: the group of fixed points of
  $\-tau$, modulo its identity component. Here additive notation is used
  for multiplicative composition; e.g., $1-\tau$ maps $z\in H$ to
  $z/\tau(z)$; this notation is natural when $\tau$ is viewed as
  operating on the weight lattice, in which case $1-\tau$ acts as the
  identity matrix minus the matrix giving $\tau$.

  Recall that the group of real points $H(R)$ is a product of $p$ unit circle
  groups, $q$ groups $R^\times$, and $r$ groups $C^\times$. It is easy to see
  that $F=(\Z/2\Z)^p$, with one factor $\Z/2\Z$ coming from each circle.

  The fiber group is represented as a subquotient of the group $H(2)$ of
  elements of order 2 (or 1) in the torus. Write $Y$ for the lattice of
  coweights of $H$; then one has natural isomorphisms $H(2)=(1/2)Y/Y=Y/2Y$.
  The Cartan involution $\tau$ is always represented by the matrix $q$ of
  its action on the character lattice $X$, which is dual to $Y$; so its action
  on $Y$ is given by the matrix $q^t$. The action of $-\tau$ on $Y$ is
  given by $-q^t$.

  Because $H$ is the product (not direct) of the connected groups
  $(H^\tau)_0$ and $(H^{-\tau})_0$, the group $H^\tau$ meets every
  component of $H^{-tau}$. The intersection of $H^\tau$ and
  $H^{-\tau}$ consists of $H(2)^\tau$, the $\tau$-fixed elements
  of order 2. It follows that the component group $F$ may be identified with
  $H(2)^\tau/(H(2)\cap (1-\tau)H)$. Thus $F$ can be represented by a
  subquotient of $H(2)=Y/2Y=(Z/2Z)^n$.

  The larger group $H(2)^\tau$ is computed as the kernel of the action of
  $(1+\tau)$ on $H(2)$, which via the isomorphism $H(2)=(Z/2Z)^n$ means
  the kernel of the reduction mod 2 of the matrix $I+q^t$. The smaller group
  $H(2)\cap (1-\tau)H$ consists of the elements of order 2 in the
  connected group $(H^{-\tau})_0$. It is computed as the reduction mod 2
  of the $-1$ eigenlattice $Y^{-\tau}$ (the latter is the lattice of
  coweights of $(H^{-tau})_0$).

  The subgroup $W^\tau$ of Weyl group elements commuting with the Cartan

  group $W^R$ of the real (that is, fixed by $-\tau$) roots, and the Weyl
  group $W^{iR}$ of the imaginary (that is, fixed by $\tau$) roots. But
  this is not all of $W^\tau$, as is easily seen in the case of complex
  groups, where both $W^R$ and $W^{iR}$ are trivial (there are no real or
  imaginary roots), yet $W$ is a direct sum of two identical factors
  interchanged by $\tau$, and the actions of diagonal elements of that sum
  clearly commute with $\tau$. In general there is a group denoted $W^C
  such that $W^\tau$ is a semidirect product of $W^R * W^{iR}$ (the normal
  subgroup) with $W^C$. Here is how to describe $W^C$.

  the sum of positive real roots, and the sum of positive imaginary roots
  (this group depends on the choice of positive roots, but all choices lead to

  sum of two isomorphic root systems $RC_0$ and $RC_1$ interchanged by $\tau$.
  (There is no canonical choice of this decomposition.) Now $W^C$ is the set
  of $\tau$-fixed elements of $W(RC_0) \times W(RC_1)$, in other words its
  diagonal subgroup.

  In general $W^C$ is not the Weyl group of a root subsystem, but it is
  isomorphic the the Weyl group of (any choice of) $RC_0$ (or of $RC_1$). We
  make a choice for $RC_0$, and |d_simpleComplex| lists its simple roots, so
