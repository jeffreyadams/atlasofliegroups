/*****************************************************************************

  This module contains the code for the command interface which we use during
  the development stage of the Atlas library. It is directly inspired by the
  interface for Coxeter, but re-written to be (hopefully) C++ conformant. In
  any case, i/o is now done in C++-style, and we also use the containers
  map and stack provided by C++, as well as the C++ string facility. Exceptions
  remain somewhat of a grey area here.

  The basic class is the |CommandNode| class, of which a few instances will be
  explitly constructed at initialisation in separate modules, such as
  mainmode.cpp. Each instance defines a set of recognized names, with
  associated action functions. These instances serve as base class for
  |CommandTree|, which includes additional links that allow defining a
  hierarchy of "modes", which is constructed in main.cpp. During this
  construction, commands are transitively inherited from ancestor to
  descendant node, unless the child defines a command of the same name as the
  parent does.

  At each point of time during execution, there is a stack of such modes, held
  in the local variable modeStack, the top of which is the currently active
  mode, with below it its ancestors (the code in the current module does not
  quite enforce the latter relation, but the action functions that may
  change the state of the stack are defined so as to respect it). Some commands
  will lead to pushing a new mode on the stack; the entry function of the mode
  is then executed. Similarly, some commands (typically the "q" command) pop
  the mode stack; this results in executing the exit function of the mode.

  A command that was originally defined in some CommandNode can be called from
  that mode or from its descendants, and may assume that the entry function
  for the mode has been executed (but not subsequently the exit function).
  This allows using values obtained interactively from the user during the
  entry function, and so limits the amount of dialogue the individual
  mathematical commands need to execute to obtain the arguments they require.
  If a command is not defined in the currently active mode, it will be
  searched in descendent modes, and if found there the command will be
  executed after performing in order the entry functions of the modes on the
  path towards the descendant. The variable commandStack serves to retain the
  name of the command to be later executed while performing the entry
  functions. Some commands (like "type" when not called from the empty mode)
  explitily alter, after a user interaction, the values stored in an already
  active mode. This in general makes the values in descendants of that mode
  invalid; such commands therefore should pop any such descendant modes. Since
  a function that was propagated by inheritance does not know from which mode
  it was called, this operation currently requires such functions to be
  explicitly redefined in all decendants of the mode it affects, each
  redefinition executing the proper number of pop operations. This might be
  improved.

  Also, there is a unique help mode, which provides some help information for
  all commands available. it has no ancestors but can be entered from any
  other mode; since it contains no mode-changing commands except "q" (which
  pops the top mode), and it inherits no commands from other modes, the help
  mode effectively disables executing anything but its own the help commands.
