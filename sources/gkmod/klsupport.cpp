  [Original note by Fokko du Cloux (no longer pertinent, thickets are avoided)]
  After some hesitation, I think I _am_ going to assume that the block has
  been sorted by length and root datum involution, and then by R-packet.
  This does make the hard case in the recursion a lot simpler to handle:
  "thickets" of representations are in fact R-packets, so they will be
  consecutively numbered.

  Fill in the table |d_prim_index|.

  For each |z| in the block, and each descent set |A|, one can from |z| either
  reach a primitive element |z'| for |A| by following 'C+' or 'i1' ascents in
  |A| , or run into an 'rn' ascent in |A| which aborts the search (because when
  this happens, one has $P_{z,y}=0$ for any |y| for which |descentSet(y)==A|).

  After doing this for any |A| and |z|, we store not |z'|, but its index in the
  list of primitives for |A|, recoreded as |prim_index[z]| below. This avoids
  having to use binary search to locate the polynomial $P_{z',y}$, provided it
  is stored at an offset |prim_index[z]| in the appropriate vector. This does
  mean we will have to store null polynomials at primitive elements to ensure
  everything is at its predicted place, while such (fairly common) polynomials
  could be suppressed when using pairs $(x,P_{x,y})$ and binary search on $x$.

  Find for |x| a primitive element for |d| above it, returning that value, or
  return |d_block.size()| if a real nonparity case is hit, or if (in partial
  blocks) ascent through a complex ascent or Cayley transform is attempted,
  which link points outside of the block (it is represented as |UnderBlock|).

  A primitive element for |desc_y| is one for which all elements in |desc_y| are
  either descents or type II imaginary ascents. So if |x| is not primitive, it
  has an ascent in |desc_y| that is either complex, imaginary type I or real
  nonparity. In the first two cases we replace |x| by the (unique) ascended
  element and continue; in the last case, we return |UndefBlock| (for K-L
  computations, this case implies that $P_{x,y}=0$; the value of |UndefBlock| is
  conveniently larger than any valid BlockElt |y|, so this case will be handled
  effortlessly together with triangularity). It is also permissible to pass
  |x==UndefBlock|, for which will |d_block.size()| be returned immediately.
