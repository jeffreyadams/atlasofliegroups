  [Original note by Fokko du Cloux (no longer pertinent, thickets are avoided)]
  After some hesitation, I think I _am_ going to assume that the block has
  been sorted by length and root datum involution, and then by R-packet.
  This does make the hard case in the recursion a lot simpler to handle:
  "thickets" of representations are in fact R-packets, so they will be
  consecutively numbered.

  Find for |x| a primitive element for |d| above it, returning that value, or
  return |d_block.size()| if a real nonparity case is hit, or if (in partial
  blocks) ascent through a complex ascent or Cayley transform is attempted,
  which link points outside of the block (it is represented as |UnderBlock|).

  A primitive element for |desc_y| is one for which all elements in |desc_y| are
  either descents or type II imaginary ascents. So if |x| is not primitive, it
  has an ascent in |desc_y| that is either complex, imaginary type I or real
  nonparity. In the first two cases we replace |x| by the (unique) ascended
  element and continue; in the last case, we return |UndefBlock| (for K-L
  computations, this case implies that $P_{x,y}=0$; the value of |UndefBlock| is
  conveniently larger than any valid BlockElt |y|, so this case will be handled
  effortlessly together with triangularity). It is also permissible to pass
  |x==UndefBlock|, for which will |d_block.size()| be returned immediately.
