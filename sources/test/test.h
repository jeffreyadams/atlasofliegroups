   |CommandTree|, as the commands would the fail to inherit to descendant
   modes. Therefore the addition cannot be done in one sweep, and the pieces
   for different |CommandNode| values are done in separate calls. Rather than
   use a single function with a switch, we might as well use a template
   function whose instances are distinguished by a dummy type. The node to
   alter is passed as argument.
