@* Outline.
%
This file describes a fundamental central part of the interpreter for the
(new) command language of the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representation software.
This part describes the fundamental type declarations used throughout the
interpreter, as well as some functions that operate on types, for instance to
see if one con be converted into another. This compilation unit is
called \.{types}, which refers both to user types as to meta-types of the
interpreter used to represent user types and other fundamental notions.

@ Each compilation unit follows a similar global pattern. While some modules
are absent in each case, the order in the implementation files is local type
definitions, global variables, local variables, local functions, global
functions (the last point being is the main goal of the implementation unit).

@ The parser produces a parse tree, in the form of a value of type |expr|
defined in the unit \.{parsetree}. Our task is to take such an expression,
analyse it and then evaluate it to obtain a value. At various points errors
can occur, which we shall have to handle gracefully: during the analysis
static ``type'' errors may prevent us from undertaking any meaningful action,
and in absence of such errors there still can be dynamic ``runtime'' errors.

We first define some data types used by the evaluator. First of all we shall
consider ``type'' values, represented by the structure |type_expr|, in terms
of which the static analysis is performed. Then we shall define the structure
of values for user data, the kind manipulated by the evaluator at runtime;
these are of classes derived from~|value_base|. Then we shall define values
that represent the user expression after type analysis, and which serve to
control the runtime actions; these are of classes derived from
|expression_base|. Finally we need some types for errors that we might have
to throw; these are the classes |program_error|, and |type_error| which is
derived from it.

Originally the |expr| value itself (possibly slightly modified during type
analysis) was used for evaluation, but it turns out to be useful to rebuild
the expression tree with a modified structure. It used to be a side benefit
that we could liberate ourselves from the constraint on data types built by
the parser, that they could be understood by a \Cee-program; currently
however \Cpp~language types can be, and are, part of the type |expr|.
Nonetheless the structure built on |expression_base| is different in many
respects from |expr|, and the transformation between these structures involves
certain processes like overloading resolution that more resemble compilation
than interpretation.

Most of these types are recursive in a manner more complicated than simple
linked lists or binary trees: at each level they represent various alternative
possibilities, each of which might recursively refer to the original type one
or more times. Such recursion is represented by linked structures that cannot
easily be hidden in a (template) class with a simple interface, such as
happens in the contained classes of the Standard Template Library. For this
reason the code using these types is to some extent exposed to the linked
nature of the data, and some concern for proper memory management will be
necessary. We shall however provide functions to facilitate safe and
consistent handling of storage of these data, while avoiding excessive
duplication during manipulation. Altogether this part of the program will be
of a quite different nature than that of the main mathematical library.

@* Types to represent types.
%
We make a fundamental choice to check types before attempting to execute any
expression entered by the user; thus type errors can be signalled earlier and
expressed more understandably than if one would wait until an accident is
about to happen at runtime. This means that types are to be represented
independently of runtime values. Types will have an effect on the
transformation of expressions into executable internal form (for example in
selecting the instance of an overloaded function to use), but once that is
done, types will no longer be represented at all: the internal code executes
without being ``aware'' of the types of the values it manipulates. This is
only possible because those values are then accessed via generic pointers
(i.e., pointers that, as far as \Cpp\ is concerned, could point to any kind of
value). Currently runtime values also contain an indication of their type,
which will allow us to do some dynamic testing to trap possible errors in the
logic of our interpreter, but the user should never notice this; in an
optimised version of the \.{atlas} program, this runtime type information and
corresponding tests could be dropped altogether.

Types are represented by small tree structures, with nodes of types
|type_expr| that will be detailed later. For now we provide no user-defined
encapsulation (as \Cpp~classes do), so a type expression basically describes
the structure of the corresponding values, and allows all operations
compatible with that structure to be performed. For instance the type printed
as \.{(int->[(bool,mat)])} specifies a function mapping integers to lists of
pairs of a Boolean value and a matrix, and allow operations compatible with
that such as calling it with an integer argument and then selecting the second
component of the final element of the result. However, classes defined in the
Atlas software library itself will be presented to the user as (opaque)
primitive types; only built-in operations declared for that primitive type can
be applied to such values, so we do provide abstraction from internal
representation there. One kind of type is a function type, which specifies the
types of the individual function arguments and of the values it returns.

Trees representing different type expressions will not share any sub-trees
among each other, so they have strict (unshared) ownership of their parts,
which simplifies memory management. This choice means some recursive copying
of tree structures is sometimes required, but (although runtime cost of type
handling is negligible with respect to other factors in the interpreter) we
avoid doing so more than absolutely necessary.

Usually types are built from the bottom up (from leaves to the root), although
during type checking the reverse also occurs. This means that nodes of the
structure are held in local variables before being moved to dynamically
managed storage; it is important to be able to do this while transferring
ownership of data linked to, which requires resetting the original node so
that it can be cleaned up without destroying dependent data. This is called
move semantics, and was originally realised using auto-pointers for individual
pointers, and by a special method on the level of complete nodes. With the
advent of \Cpp11, special syntactic support was added, so that one can
distinguish calls that should be realised with shallow copies and ownership
transfer from the occasionally needed deep copy. At the same time
auto-pointers were replaced by unique-pointers, with essentially the same
functionality, but better adapted to the syntactic facilities. The structure
also uses ordinary pointers of type~|type_p| when ownership is managed by the
containing structure.

@< Type definitions @>=
class type_expr;
typedef type_expr* type_p;
typedef const type_expr* const_type_p;
typedef std::unique_ptr<type_expr> type_ptr;

@*2 Type lists.
%
We also need type lists as building block for types (for instance for the
arguments of a function). These used to be defined in a similar manner to
types themselves, but since an STL-compatible singly-linked list container
class templates |simple_list| and |sl_list| was added to the Atlas utilities
library, these were used to replace the implementation of type lists.

@< Includes needed in \.{axis-types.h} @>=
#include "sl_list.h" // for internals of the |sl_list| class template

@ The class template |simple_list| is built into the structure itself, while
|sl_list|, which is more flexible but requires more space at the head of the
list (the class |sl_list<type_expr>| itself), is occasionally used for
temporary variables. This provides a good test for the usability of the new
container type; so far it has passed them gracefully, though occasionally
after enriching the repertoire of methods of the container type.

@< Type definitions @>=
typedef containers::simple_list<type_expr> type_list;
typedef atlas::containers::sl_node<type_expr>* raw_type_list;
typedef containers::sl_list<type_expr> dressed_type_list;
typedef containers::weak_sl_list_const_iterator<type_expr> wtl_const_iterator;
typedef containers::weak_sl_list_iterator<type_expr> wtl_iterator;
  // wtl = weak type list

@ Since types and type lists own their trees, their copy constructors must
make a deep copy. The class |type_expr| will provide no copy constructor but
instead a more visible |copy| method to do a deep copy. On some occasions
however one rather needs a copy at the pointer level: one has access to a
pointer to some |type_expr| (possibly by simply taking its address), but one
needs an owning |type_ptr| instead. The function |acquire| will achieve this.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
type_ptr acquire(const type_expr* t);

@~The function |acquire| simply creates a unique-pointer from the call of
|new| whose constructor invokes the |copy| method of |type_expr| pointed to.
The latter, has a recursive definition that performs a deep copy, but the
details (given in section @#type expression copy@>) don't concern us here.

@< Function definitions @>=
type_ptr acquire(const type_expr* t) @+
{@; return type_ptr(new type_expr(t->copy())); }


@ Type lists are usually built by starting with a default-constructed
|type_list| (which is equivalent to initialising it with |empty_tuple()|
defined below, and which function can help avoid a Most Vexing Parse
situation), and repeatedly calling |prefix| to add nodes in front. This
function is efficient, due its use of move-semantics, both for the node, and
for the list itself. Nonetheless, the latter is passed as a modifiable lvalue
reference |dst|, as it will continue to hold the extended list.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
type_list empty_tuple();
type_list& prefix(type_expr&& t, type_list& dst);
dressed_type_list& prefix(type_expr&& t, dressed_type_list& dst);

@ Move semantics, introduced in \Cpp11, has solved any difficulty with
ownership management that the functions below previously had to deal with.

@< Function def... @>=
type_list empty_tuple() @+{@; return type_list(); }
@)
type_list& prefix(type_expr&& t, type_list& dst)
{@; dst.push_front(std::move(t));
   return dst;
}
dressed_type_list& prefix(type_expr&& t, dressed_type_list& dst)
{@; dst.push_front(std::move(t));
  return dst;
}

@*2 Primitive types.
%
We have a simple but flexible type model. There is a finite number of
``primitive'' types, many of which are abstractions of complicated classes
defined in the Atlas library, such as root data or reductive groups.
Furthermore one has function types that map one type to another, types that
are ``row of'' some other type, tuples (Cartesian products) of some given
sequence of types, and disjoint unions (co-products in the category of sets)
of some sequence of types.

In addition to these, we allow for two more possibilities, that do not
correspond to way in which values can be built up. The final possibility
|tabled| provides a way to reference a type indirectly (its details are to be
found after looking up the reference), which is essential for being able to
specify recursive types. We also allow for an undetermined type, which can
serve as a wild-card to specify type patterns.

Before we can define |type_expr|, we need to enumerate its variants and the
possibilities for primitive types. Here are enumerations of tags for the basic
kinds of types, and for the sub-cases of |primitive_type| (some of them will be
introduced later).

@< Type definitions @>=
enum type_tag
 { undetermined_type, primitive_type,
   function_type, row_type, tuple_type, union_type,
   tabled
 };

enum primitive_tag
{ integral_type, rational_type, string_type, boolean_type
  , @< Other primitive type tags @>@;@; @|
  @+nr_of_primitive_types };

@ For printing types (and later for parsing them) we shall need names for the
primitive ones.

@< Declarations of global variables @>=

extern const char* prim_names[];

@~Here is the list of names of the primitive types (some are given later),
terminated by a null pointer. The last name |"void"| is not a primitive name,
corresponds to |nr_of_primitive_types|, and will be treated exceptionally in
|mk_prim_type| to make an empty tuple type instead.

@< Global variable definitions @>=
const char* prim_names[]=@/
{"int","rat","string","bool",@< Other primitive type names@>@;@;@+
 "void", nullptr };

@*1 Type expressions.
%
Type expressions are defined by a tagged union. We intend to always only access
the variant corresponding to the current tag value, but this is not something
that can be statically ascertained in \Cpp; therefore the tag and the
corresponding variants originally had public access. We have none nonetheless
made the fields private with public accessor methods, which will automatically
insert a look-up for any type with |tag=tabled|. That kind of type is necessary
to represent types with a recursive structure; the look-up uses the static
member |type_map|, which will be discussed later.

The field |tuple_variant| used to be (after inclusion of the
|containers::simple_list| class template in Atlas, which coincided with the
migration to the \Cpp11 standard) of type |type_list|. Having variant members
of a |union| with nontrivial special member functions is allowed in \Cpp11,
although it remains the programmer's responsibility to explicitly call
constructors and destructors as those variants come and go. Currently this is
changed to |raw_type_list|; the main difference is that the variant can now be
initiated by simple assignment rather than placement |new|, and at termination
requires a call of |delete| for the raw pointer rather than an explicit
destructor call for the |type_list| object. This step backwards to raw
pointers is therefore mostly a simplification, but there is one real drawback
of not having a true |type_list| object: it is now impossible to create a
|type_list::iterator| (or its |const| relative) to iterate over the type lists
in tuple types. It turns out however that most of the time weak iterators
(which do not allow for insertion of deletion of nodes) are sufficient, which
is why the |raw_type_list| solution is now chosen.

There is one restriction on types that is not visible in the definition below,
namely that the list of types referred to by the |tuple_variant| field cannot
have length~$1$ (but length~$0$ is allowed, the $0$-tuple being the |void|
type; we might also take the $0$-union to be the uninhabited type \.* that is
for instance the ``return type'' of the |error| function, but this is not
currently the case). This is because anything that would suggest a $1$-tuple
or $1$-union (for instance a parenthesised expression) is identified with its
unique component.

  const type_expr& expansion () const; // type corresponding to |type_number|
@)
  @< Methods of the |type_expr| class @>@;
 };

@ Every variant of the union gets its own constructor that directly constructs
the |type_expr| structure under this variant of the structure, and in addition
there is a default constructor that sets |kind==undetermined_type| and
constructs no variant at all (in \Cpp\ \emph{at most} one variant of a union is
active). Since all variants of the |union| are POD types (such as raw pointers)
it may be convenient to first default-construct a |type_expr| and then change
its variant while assigning to the corresponding field. The destructor for
|type_expr| must take care to explicitly call |delete| if the active field is a
pointer.

A move constructor for |type_expr| is provided, but no copy constructor;
instead of the latter we provide a |copy| method explicitly creating a deep
copy value, to which one may then apply move-construction. We similarly
provide a move assignment operator, which implicitly makes the copy assignment
operator deleted (rather then implicitly provided), and a |swap| method (as
proof-of-concept, it is not currently used). Two special cases of (partial)
move semantics are provided for however, for replacing an undefined (or
partially undefined) type by a more specific type (note that in these cases
nothing disappears, so no clean-up is necessary). The first case, the
|set_from| method, makes a shallow copy of its argument into the object for
which is was called, which is required to be undetermined initially. This
method that was present long before \Cpp11 allowed proper move semantics is in
fact used to implement the move constructor and move assignment operator. The
second case, the |specialise| method, is used during type analysis, to see if
our type matches a given pattern, or in case it was (partially) undefined
whether it can be made to match the pattern by if necessary replacing some
undetermined descendants by more specific ones. The call returns a value
indicating whether this was possible, and if so makes the necessary
specialisations to our type. That is done by copying, so the caller does not
require, acquire, or lose ownership of the pattern for/by this method.

The constructors for the row, tuple, and union types receive pointers that
will be directly inserted into our |struct| and become owned by it; the
ownership management is simplest when such pointers are ``passed by check'',
i.e., as rvalue references to smart pointers.

@ For that definition to be processed properly, we must pay some attention to
ordering of type definitions, because of the recursions present. The structure
|func_type| will contain instances of |type_expr|, so its definition must
follow, but since we used a pointer to such a structure, it must be declared
as a structure before the definition of |type_expr| is seen. For type lists
this kind of difficulty is taken care of because |simple_list<type_expr>|
could be used in a |typedef| before |type_expr| was a complete type.

@ Instead of a regular copy constructor, which would have to make a deep copy
(because these descendants are owned by the object), |type_expr| provides a
method |copy| that recursively copies the descendant types; this way the
inadvertent making of deep copies is avoided. If necessary the |type_expr|
move constructor can be applied to the temporary for the result from |copy|,
but this can probably always be avoided by return value optimisation (and in
any case move construction costs little). Using a named function here results
in the recursion being visible in the argument the calls of |new|. Since this
is not a constructor, the pointers returned from |new| are immediately owned
when stored in a component of |type_expr| (and even if this had been a
constructor, no exception can happen between the storing the pointer and
termination).

@:type expression copy@>

@< Function definitions @>=
type_expr type_expr::copy() const
{ type_expr result;
  switch (result.tag=tag)
  { case undetermined_type: break;
    case primitive_type: result.prim_variant=prim_variant; break;
    case function_type: result.func_variant=new
      func_type(func_variant->copy());

    case tabled: result.type_number=type_number; break;
  }
  return result;
}

@ We create a duplicate list by applying the |copy| method for all members of
the list accessed from |tuple_variant|. The code below originally
placement-constructed that list into the |result.tuple_variant| field,
initially default constructing the list, and then adding the components using
|insert| through an output iterator |oit| pointing at the end of the list.
This had to be modified when |tuple_variant| was made to by a raw pointer,
from which we cannot create an |type_list::iterator| (this is one of the rare
places in the code where that matters). So now we instead create an initially
empty |type_list dst@;| and make an iterator for it; then after creating the
nodes of the list, the |type_list| is demoted to |raw_type_list| by calling
its |release| method, which raw pointer is assigned to |result.tuple_variant|.

@< Assign a deep copy of |tuple_variant| to |result.tuple_variant| @>=
{
  wtl_const_iterator it(tuple_variant);
  type_list dst;
  for (type_list::iterator oit = dst.begin(); not it.at_end(); ++it,++oit)
    dst.insert(oit,it->copy());
  result.tuple_variant = dst.release(); // incorporate and transfer ownership
}

@ The method |clear|, doing the work for the destructor, must similarly clean
up afterwards, with the recursion again being implicit. We set |tag =
undetermined_type| to indicate that no variant is active; this condition is
tested in the |set_from| method (and also in by the destructor, though if
|clear| is \emph{called by} the destructor, that test is already behind us).

There is no reason to use a smart pointers as variant of a union, since one
must still explicitly propagate destruction to the active variant, as happens
here for the |tuple_variant| field. If it were done here, then all that would
change is that the code below would have to call their destructors rather than
call |delete| directly.

@< Function definitions @>=
void type_expr::clear() noexcept
{ switch (tag)
  { case undetermined_type: case primitive_type: break;
    case function_type: delete func_variant; break;
    case row_type: delete row_variant; break;
    case tuple_type: case union_type: delete tuple_variant; break;
    case tabled: break;
  }
  tag = undetermined_type;
}

@ The method |set_from| makes a shallow copy of the structure; it implements
move semantics. Correspondingly it takes as argument another |type_expr| by
modifiable rvalue reference. The contents of its top-level structure will be
moved to the current |type_expr| using move assignment where applicable, and
then set to a empty |undetermined_type| value, which effectively detaches any
possible descendants from it. This operation requires that |type_expr|
previously had |tag==undetermined_type|. We test this condition using an
|assert| statement (rather than throwing |logic_error|) to honour the
|noexcept| specification.

The moving copy constructor is nearly identical to the |set_from| method.

@ The |specialise| method is mostly used to either set a completely
undetermined type to a given pattern, or to test if it already matches it;
however, we do not exclude the possibility that a partly determined type is
modified by specialisation of one of its descendants to match the given
pattern. Matching a pattern means being at least as specific, and specialising
means replacing by something more specific, so we are (upon success) replacing
the type for which the method is called by the most general unifier (i.e.,
common specialisation) of its previous value and |pattern|. Therefore the name
of this method is somewhat misleading, in that the specialisation is not
necessarily to |pattern|, but to something matching |pattern|.

In the case of an |undetermined_type|, |specialise| uses the |set_from| method
to make |*this| a copy of |pattern|. In the other cases we only continue if
the top levels of both type declarers match, in which case we try to
recursively specialise all descendants. We do not guarantee
commit-or-roll-back, in other words, when the specialisation fails, some
modifications to our type may still have been made. This is no problem in most
situations, since failure to specialise $t_1$ to $t_2$ will usually be
followed by an attempt to coerce $t_2$ to $t_1$, or by throwing of an error;
here any specialisation that brings $t_1$ closer to $t_2$ cannot be harmful
(it probably makes no difference at all). And we provide an accessor method
|can_specialise| that could be tested before calling |specialise| in cases
where having commit-or-roll-back is important.

This method must pay some nontrivial attention to types with |tag==tabled|,
whose (possibly recursive) meaning is stored in |type_expr::type_map|. If one
of the two types concerned is of this kind, it is basically replaced by its
expansion. When it is |*this| itself that is expanded, we do not want to
recursively call the manipulator |specialise| for the expansion, but luckily
there is never anything to substitute into defined types, so we can just call
the method |can_specialise| instead to determine the Boolean result. When both
type expressions have |tag==tabled| we must avoid potentially infinite
recursion when both are expanded; by ensuring (upon entering type definitions)
that defined types are only equal if they have the same name, the code here is
reduced to just a test of the type names.

Therefore we must declare and name the structure type before using it in

that, we also define a constructor to fill the structure (it was used above)
and a move constructor.

The |func_type| structure has two sub-objects of type |type_expr|,
rather than pointers to them. A move constructor only makes a
shallow copy of the topmost nodes in the same way as was done in the move
constructor for~|type_expr|. Like for |type_expr| we do not provide an
ordinary copy constructor, but a value-returning |copy| accessor method.

@*2 Storage of defined, possibly recursive, types.
%
We come to a new part of the |type_expr| type, a static member that allows
names in types to be used that stand for certain type expressions. The
mechanism has been around some time, but was previously implemented by just
replacing the type name by the corresponding type expression after
having been input.

The sub-class |type_expr::defined_type_mapping| is basically a vector of type
expressions possibly paired to a type identifier and maybe a list of field names
(for tuples or unions, mostly useful for the latter). The variant |type_number|
of |type_expr| will record an \emph{index} into this vector (not the value of
the possibly associated identifier). We provide a selection operation
|defined_type| that returns a non owned reference the such a type expression.
This class does not hide its data (though it does have one private method
|dissect+type_to|), but the unique object of this class is a private member
of |type_expr|, so access is mostly controlled by static methods of that class.

The possibility to have unnamed types in the mapping will turn out to be useful
in implementation, since by adding such entries we can ensure that all sub-types
of types in the table are also present. For such unnamed types the type
identifier will have the value $-1$, but their index can still be used as
|type_number|. The |fields| component can also be unused (and empty); when set
it records filed names that usually are also bound to injector or projector
functions in the overload table, but their presence here serves mostly for
correctly interpreting |union|-controlled |case| expressions, which need to
associate tags identifying the variants of a given |union| type.

@< Type definitions @>=

{ static constexpr id_type no_id = -1;

};

@~We need to define that declared static class member; it starts out empty.
@< Global variable definitions @>=
type_expr::defined_type_mapping type_expr::type_map;

@ A number of additional methods of |type_expr| are all |static| and just serve
to regulate access to the static class member |type_map|. Most of them simply
serve as a hatch (dutch: ``doorgeefluik'', no good English equivalent) to pass
on information, the method |add_typedefs| serving to enter a list of newly
defined (potentially recursive) types into |type_map| is quite elaborate. Its
argument is a list |defs| of pairings of a type identifier to a type expression.
The potentially recursive nature of these definitions lies in that they can not
only refer, using the |type_number| variant, to type already defined in the
mapping, but also to the types they define themselves. For this purpose, those
recursive type numbers start to count from |type_expr::table_size()| as it is
before |add_typedefs| method is called. The return value is a list of the same
length giving their type numbers after applying type equivalencing~; usually
these will be the same numbers used initially, but some may have mapped to
equivalent previously known types.

@< Static methods of |type_expr| that will access |type_map| @>=
static std::vector<type_nr_type>
  add_typedefs(const std::vector<std::pair<id_type,const_type_p> >& defs);

static void set_fields (id_type type_number, std::vector<id_type>&& fields);
static const std::vector<id_type>& fields(type_nr_type type_number);

@ Here are the easy ones among those methods: |table_size| just returns the
current |size| of |type_map|; the method |add| linearly searches for tabled
types having been given the passed |type_name| (one should have been created by
a previous call to |add_typedefs|, and sets is its |fields| list; |find| locates
a type given by an expression and returns is associated identifier. There is no
method to remove the name of a tabled type, as doing so might lead to
non-termination of printing recursive types.

{@; return type_map[type_number].name; }

const type_expr& type_expr::expansion() const @+
{@; return type_map.defined_type(type_number); }

@ Here is a type definition that we shall need presently. The structure
essentially extends all relevant |type_expr| values (which will be collected
in an array) temporarily with a |rank| field. The provided constructor
initially leaves it unset, as it will be explicitly set later.

The typedef |p_list| will be of use later, when sorting pointers to these
|type_data|.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct type_data
{ type_expr type; unsigned int rank;
  type_data(type_expr&& e) : type(std::move(e)) @+{}
  type_data(): type() @+{}
};
typedef containers::sl_list<type_data *> p_list; // list of type pointers

@~The definition of |type_expr::add_typedefs| is subtle and requires quite a bit
of work, due to our requirement that all cases of type equivalence be
recognised, and each equivalence class reduced to a single entry. Thus we trade
off getting a more rapid and (more importantly) simpler equivalence test during
actual type checking against additional time spent in processing type
definitions. Type equivalence is defined in a conceptually simple way: each
recursive type gives rise by repeated expansion of the defining relations to a
unique, possibly infinite, type tree; we use structural equivalence of those
trees. This does not give a practical algorithm for testing equivalence, so
instead we use the following ``bottom-up'' technique. We gather all types
descending from currently given type definitions (which is a finite collection)
and partition it according to structural differences found (such as: a procedure
type is never equivalent to a row type, tuple types with different numbers of
components are never equivalent, etc.). Then we refine that partition by looking
at relations among descendent types, and repeat this until no change occurs any
more; types that still occur in the same part apparently cannot be shown to
differ in a finite number of steps, so they must be equivalent.

This approach would be most efficient if it could be done once and for all when
all type definitions are known, but in an interpreter we must be able to process
commands one by one, so we repeat the operation every time a new set of type
definitions comes along, which hopefully is not too often. We can limit our
embarrassment by keeping our |defined_type_mapping| in a form that makes
restarting the equivalencing relatively easy, namely by ensuring (as mentioned
above) that all sub-types of types in the table have their own entries.

  @< For each equivalence class that has no representatives among the types
     already present, add a corresponding entry to |type_map|, and push to
     |result| the types for the entries of |defs| in |tabled| form @>
  return result;
}

@ The following is not conceptually hard, but it took us long thought to find a
somewhat elegant solution. We want |type_array| to hold |type_expr| values whose
descendent sub-types (if any) are also stored in |type_array|, and are
represented using types with |tag==tabled|; we shall call types for which
this holds ``fully dissected'' for ease of reference. However, we do not want
any |type_array[i].tag| to be |tabled| since that would just equate one entry
to another (or itself) with no indication about even its top-level structure. So
the top level structure of each entry should be explicit, and for types with any
descendants this means that apart from the |type_expr| present in |type_array|,
one dynamically allocated node, for instance of type |func_type|, should be
present.

We may (and do) assume entries from |*this| to be already fully dissected, but
for the newly added definitions from |defs| the dissection has to be done here.
Apart from the entries directly coming from |defs|, this may require adding
additional ones to |type_array|, but we want the former to get the first set of
new slots, because they may already be being referred to by |type_number| inside
the defining type expressions. We initially solved this by reserving empty slots
in |type_array| for the entries from |defs|, then dissecting the type
expressions from |defs| (possibly extending |type_array| at the end), and
finally move the |type_expr| produced into the empty slot (using the
|type_expr::set_from|). However this was error prone, and indeed was done
incorrectly in a first version, because a reference to an empty slot may become
invalid (dangling) if during dissection |type_array| needs to be expanded
(reallocated). But |containers::simple_list| (of which |dressed_type_list| is an
instance) is perfectly suited to this task, as we can avoid any empty slots by
inserting the resulting types in the middle of the list being expanded without
any risk of dangling references; this is the approach used now. It just needs to
take care of one extra point, namely to precompute the position |count| where
numbering of additional types produced during dissection will start. The
auxiliary method |dissect_type_to| of |type_expr|, to be defined below, does the
actual dissection, using the |types| list to append and descendent types to, and
|count| to keep track of their future |type_number| values.

@< Copy types from |type_map| to |type_array|, then add entries for they types
   defined by |defs| and all their anonymous sub-types;

{
  dressed_type_list types;
  for (auto it=type_map.begin(); it!=type_map.end(); ++it)
    types.push_back(it->type.copy());
  type_nr_type count=types.size()+defs.size();
    // start numbering auxiliary types here
  auto insert_pt = types.end();
    // place where new types will go; their descendents will come after
  for (auto it=defs.cbegin(); it!=defs.cend(); ++it)
    insert_pt = types.insert(insert_pt,it->second->dissect_type_to(types,count));
@)
  type_array.reserve(types.size()); // necessary to do the following in one loop
  for (auto it=types.wbegin(); it!=types.wend(); ++it)
  {
    type_array.emplace_back(std::move(*it));
      // also expands |type_expr| to |type_data|
    type_perm.push_back(&type_array.back());
  }
}

@ The method |dissect_type_to| sections the type expression for which it is
called into |dst|, and then returns a dissected |type_expr| for~|t|; clearly
something for a recursive function. But while in the root call a |type_expr| is
needed for insertion into an empty slot, the |type_expr| is to be added to |dst|
in all recursive calls, and then replaced by a type with |tag==tabled| referring
to it. Therefore we make this into a mutually recursive pair of functions, with
a second method |to_table| that wraps the latter stuff only needed in the
recursive calls.

private:
  type_expr dissect_type_to (dressed_type_list& dst, type_nr_type& count) const;

@ The recursion stops in |to_table| whenever a type with |tag==tabled| is
encountered, which is what ensures termination. Hence if |dissect_type_to|
should find |tag==tabled|, this can only be during the root call, and means the
user has been equating one type name directly to another. This possibility seems
somewhat silly, and is a potential cause of trivially recursive type definitions
(defining a type directly or indirectly as itself), so rather than handling it,
we for now decide that the possibility should be ruled out syntactically (a bare
type identifiers will not be accepted as right hand side); therefore we
|assert(false)| for this case below.

   |type_perm[i]->rank| field to the first index~|i| of a pointer in the same

{ unsigned int count=0; // maintain the index into |type_perm| here
  for (unsigned int i=0; i<prim_types.size(); ++i)
    empty_bucket (prim_types[i],count,type_perm,groups);

  assert(count==type_perm.size());
}

@ We now make some preparations for refining the ordering in |type_perm| inside
the established ``buckets''. This involves comparing types based on (the ranks
of) their descendent sub-types, which the bucket-sorting ignored. Due to our
preparations, such sub-types are always represented with |tag==tabled|,
which means that we can find the associated rank as
|type_arr[t.type_number].rank|. But we shall need to access that from within
comparison functions, which do not know about |type_arr|, which forces us to
pass a reference (called |a|) to |type_arr| around as additional parameter.
(Alternatively we might have defined |rank_of| as a \Cpp~macro with just $t$ as
argument.) The (hopefully inlined) function |rank_of| does this look-up. Since
we only need to compare types of the same outer structure, we can write separate
functions for comparing function-, row-, tuple-, and union types; there is no
need to compare primitive types, since not having descendents, their sorting is
already as refined as it will get. The comparison functions return an integer
value, but its only relevance is whether it is negative, zero, or positive.

@ Now for the actual sorting routine, we opt for merge sorting using linked
lists, as this will allow us some practice with |containers::sl_list|. Indeed we
extended the multi-purpose method |splice| with a full (according to
|std::forward_list::splice_after|) repertoire of instances, in order to make
this code compile.

The first instance of |splice| serves to split up a list into two almost equal
halves (we prefer the first part larger in the odd length case), the second to
move a tail portion from |l1| to |l0| once we get to the end of the latter, and
the third call is the normal case that copies just one node from |l0| into the
proper location of~|l0|.

{ const auto len = length(l0);
  if (len<2)
    return;
  p_list l1; // will hold the second half of |l0|
  l1.splice(l1.begin(),l0,std::next(l0.begin(),(len+1)/2),l0.end());
   // split halfway, or just after
  merge_sort(l0,cmp,a);
  merge_sort(l1,cmp,a);
  auto it=l0.begin();
  do
  // merge |l1| into |l0| at using |it| as current insertion position, stop if  either reaches its end
    if (cmp(*it,l1.front(),a)<=0)
    { ++it; // element from |l0| passes before |l1|
      if (l0.at_end(it))
      {@;
        l0.splice(it,l1);
        return;
      }
    }
    else
    { l0.splice(it,l1,l1.begin());
      // element from |l1| passes before rest of |l0|
      if (l1.empty())
        return;
    }
  while(assert(not(l0.at_end(it) or l1.empty())),true);
}

@ The heart of type equivalence testing consists of propagating any
differences visible in the |rank| fields from descendent types to their
parents, and updating the rank fields of the latter to reflect the change;
repeating this until no more refinement occurs anywhere. The propagation is
done by calling |merge_sort| for each group of previously indistinguishable
types, which will separate types that can now be distinguished based on the
|rank| fields of their descendents, while keeping together those that still
cannot be distinguished. Due to our preparations, within such groups types
will necessarily have the same top level structure which differs from
|primitive_type|, so that we can use one of the specific comparison functions
above for the sorting. Once the sorting is done, we find the new separations
between now distinguished types, which will introduce new values for |rank|
that we then associate to the types, thus refining the effect of future calls
of the comparison function.

It is important that we are only refining a partition here, and that our goal is
not to sort all of |type_perm| according to some definite ordering. If the
latter were the case, it would be a problem that changes to |rank| fields may
invert the relative order of two types under |cmp| (in the scenario where a
first test in for instance |cmp_tu_types| finds no distinction, while a test
further down the list does find a distinction, but where later the first test
changes in the opposite sense). However we only care about types being found to
be distinct during sorting, and such a verdict is definitive; once a distinction
is established, the types will never again be compared during refinement. These
considerations justify the fact that we update |rank| fields for some groups,
while other groups have not been sorted yet; the updates can influence the
result of the later sorting, but only in the sense to make refinement progress
more rapidly, which we shall not complain about.

@< Repeatedly sort and refine each bucket content, using the |rank| fields

    }
  }
  while (changes);
}

@ Groups of types among which, with current |rank| values, |cmp| finds no
distinctions must be skipped. This enables termination (in case they
turn out to be equivalent); doing |continue| avoids setting |changes|.

      break;
  if (i>=it->second) // the above loop ran to completion
@/{@; ++it; continue; } // so skip group whose refinement would change nothing
}

@ There is a subtlety below, in that we should not change any |rank| fields
while we are calling |cmp| to inspect the result of sorting, since such
changes might alter the results of later calls of |cmp| to no longer
correspond to the relations as they held during sorting. So instead we set
aside the new ranks that we want to assign to the types whose pointers are
being moved here, in a temporary array |new_ranks|, to do the actual
assignments only later once all refined groups have been established.

@< Copy elements from |l| back to |type_perm|... @>=
{ auto jt=l.begin(); auto loc=it->first; // index into |type_perm|
  std::vector<unsigned int> new_ranks;
  new_ranks.reserve(it->second-it->first);

  { const auto first_loc=loc;
    do // find a new group
    { type_perm[loc++]=*jt;
      new_ranks.push_back(first_loc);
    }
    while (not l.at_end(++jt) and cmp(type_perm[first_loc],*jt,type_array)==0);
    if (loc-first_loc>=2) // don't create singleton groups
      it=groups.insert(it,std::make_pair(first_loc,loc)); // prepend this pair
  }
@)
  assert(loc==it->second);
  loc=it->first; // restart
  for (auto p = new_ranks.begin(); p!=new_ranks.end(); ++p)
    type_perm[loc++]->rank=*p;
  groups.erase(it); // remove refined group; |it| should not be incremented
}

@ Now it is time to finally copy entries back to (the
|std::vector<type_binding>| base object of) |*this|, from |type_array|. All the
work that was done so far served to set the |rank| fields such that types are
equivalent if and only if their |rank| fields are the same. The first |size()|
of them should certainly have distinct |rank| fields, since they were already
reduced to a list without equivalences by earlier calls of our |add_typedefs|
method. What we shall do is run over entries of |type_array| in increasing
order, and each time a previously unseen value of |rank| is found, copy the
corresponding |type| field from |type_array| to |type_map|. We need to combine
that with the |id_type| component (the name the user chose to associate with the
newly defined type) which was left behind (by |dissect_type_to|) in the argument
|defs| to the |add_typedefs| method; fortunately we have not left the method
yet, so there is no problem in doing so.

The act of moving only the first representative of each equivalence class of
types can cause a renumbering of |type_number| values to be necessary to
preserve meaning; this should only be the case for newly defined types, and they
can only be referred to from other new types. We keep track of the
correspondence between the |rank| value characterising the equivalence class and
its new |type_number| value in the array |renumber|, which also serves to record
which |rank| values have already been seen.

@< For each equivalence class that has no representatives among the types
   already present, add a corresponding entry to |type_map|, and push to
   |result| the types for the entries of |defs| in |tabled| form @>=
{ constexpr type_nr_type absent = -1;
  const auto old_size=type_map.size();
  const auto first_new=type_array.begin()+old_size;
  unsigned int count = 0;
  std::vector<type_nr_type> renumber(type_perm.size(),absent);
  for (auto it = type_array.begin(); it!=type_array.end(); ++it)
    if (it<first_new)
      assert(renumber[it->rank]==absent),renumber[it->rank]=count++;
    else if (renumber[it->rank]==absent)
  @/{@;
      renumber[it->rank]=count++;
      type_map.emplace_back(std::move(it->type));
    }
  for (unsigned int i=0; i<defs.size(); ++i)
  { type_nr_type nr= renumber[(first_new+i)->rank];
    result.push_back(nr); // to be converted by client to |tabled| type
    if (type_map[nr].name==type_binding::no_id
        // don't overwrite an existing type name
       @+and type_map[nr].type.tag!=primitive_type) // nor name a primitive type

  }
  @< Update, for types beyond position |old_size|, their descendent types
     according to |renumber| @>
}

@ For a given |type_expr t@;|, which should have |t.tag==tabled|, renumbering
consists of looking up the rank of element indexed by |t.type_number| in
|type_array|, and taking the value from |renumber| indexed by that rank. This is
needed several times, but rather than define a function (which would need
additional arguments to access the tables) we define a macro
|renumber_type_nr_from_rank| to do the work. The code for actually doing the
renumbering just loops over the relevant part of |*this|, does case distinction
by |tag|, and invokes |renumber_type_nr_from_rank| wherever applicable.

@d renumber_type_nr_from_rank(t) assert((t).raw_kind()==tabled),t=type_expr(renumber[type_array[(t).type_number].rank])
@< Update, for types beyond position |old_size|, their descendent types

    { default: break; // nothing for types without descendents
    case function_type:
    { auto f = it->type.func_variant;
    @/renumber_type_nr_from_rank(f->arg_type);
      renumber_type_nr_from_rank(f->result_type);
    }
      break;
    case row_type: renumber_type_nr_from_rank(*it->type.row_variant);
      break;

        renumber_type_nr_from_rank(*jt);
      break;
    }
}

@ Finally we need a comparison for structural equality of type expressions.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
bool operator== (const type_expr& x,const type_expr& y);
inline bool operator!= (const type_expr& x,const type_expr& y)
{@; return !(x==y); }

operands to be |const|.

    return x.raw_kind()==tabled ? x.expansion()==y  : x==y.expansion();
  }
  switch (x.raw_kind())
  { case undetermined_type: return true;
    case primitive_type: return x.prim()==y.prim();

      // only equal type numbers give equal types here

         and *it0==*it1)
    @/{@; ++it0; ++it1; }
  return it0.at_end() and it1.at_end();
  // whether both lists terminated
}

@*2 Printing types.
%
For printing types, we pass |type_expr| values to the operator~`|<<|' by
constant reference; passing by pointer could be defined, but we avoid this in
general, as would override a language-provided definition that prints a
hexadecimal value, which (without being very useful) would prevent the compiler
from signalling a possibly forgotten overload definition. Since we often hold
types in |type_ptr| values, this does mean the we must then dereference
explicitly when calling the operators below.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const type_expr& t);
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const func_type& f);

@~Printing types is relegated to the |type_exp::print| method. Before we define
it, here are two auxiliary function for printing sequences of types (inside
tuple and union types) and function types. For the latter we suppress
additional parentheses around argument and result types in case these are
tuple or union types.

@< Function definitions @>=

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const type_expr& t)
{@; t.print(out); return out; }
@)
void print(std::ostream& out, const raw_type_list& l,char sep)
{ wtl_const_iterator it(l);
  if (not it.at_end())
    while (out << *it, not (++it).at_end())
      out << sep;
}

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const func_type& f)
{
  out << '(';
  if (f.arg_type.raw_kind()==tuple_type or
      f.arg_type.raw_kind()==union_type and f.arg_type.tuple()!=nullptr)
     print(out,f.arg_type.tuple(),@|f.arg_type.raw_kind()==tuple_type?',':'|');
     // naked tuple or union
  else out << f.arg_type; // other component type
  out << "->";
  if (f.result_type.raw_kind()==tuple_type or @|
      f.result_type.raw_kind()==union_type and f.result_type.tuple()!=nullptr)
     print(out,f.result_type.tuple(),f.result_type.raw_kind()==tuple_type?',':'|');
     // tuple, union
  else out << f.result_type; // other component type
  return out << ')';
}

@ And here is the | type_expr::print| method. Note that when |tag==tabled| we
print its |type_name()| if one is provided; if not then we expand this (unnamed,
yet present in |type_map|) type. Any recursion must pass through a named type,
so infinite recursion should not be possible.

@< Function definitions @>=

void type_expr::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ switch(tag)
  { case undetermined_type: out << '*'; break;
    case primitive_type: out << prim_names[prim()]; break;
    case function_type: out << *func_variant; break;
    case row_type: out << '[' << *row_variant << ']'; break;
    case tuple_type:
      if (tuple_variant==nullptr)
        out << "void";
      else
      {@;
         interpreter::print(out << '(', tuple_variant,',');
         out << ')';
      }
    break;
    case union_type:
      if (tuple_variant==nullptr)
        out << "(*)"; // this should not really occur
      else
      {@;
         interpreter::print(out << '(', tuple_variant,'|');
         out << ')';
      }
    break;
    case tabled:
      if (type_map[type_number].name!=type_binding::no_id)
        out << main_hash_table->name_of(type_name());
      else out << expansion();
        // expand out when no identifier is attached
    break;
  }
}

@*2 Type constructing functions.
%
Instead of using the constructors directly, we often use the constructing
functions below. The versions with |mk| return |type_ptr| values owning the
constructed expression. They also take such smart pointers, or |type_list|
values, as argument whenever the underlying pointer is to be directly inserted
into the structure built. However for |mk_function_type| this is not the case,
so instead of insisting that the caller hold a unique-pointer to the argument
types it suffices to hold a |type_expr| whose contents can be moved into the
type to be constructed. If |t| is a |type_ptr| held by a client, it can pass
|std::move(*t)| as argument to |mk_function_type|, which will move the
contents of the node |t| points to into the function type, and after return
the destructor of |t| will eventually delete the now empty node.

The functions with |make| are wrappers that do the same thing, but undress the
smart pointers in their interface to raw pointers; these functions
should be used exclusively in the parser. In other words these raw pointers
are owning, as if they were smart pointers, and in fact the functions convert
their arguments into unique pointers right away, and produce their results by
calling the |release| method of a unique pointer. This travesty is done just
so that the parser only sees POD, types which it can put into a |union|.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
type_ptr mk_prim_type(primitive_tag p);
type_ptr mk_function_type(type_expr&& a, type_expr&& r);
type_ptr mk_row_type(type_ptr&& c);
type_ptr mk_tuple_type (type_list&& l);
type_ptr mk_union_type (type_list&& l);
@)
type_p make_prim_type(unsigned int p);
type_p make_function_type(type_p a,type_p r);
type_p make_row_type(type_p c);
type_p make_tuple_type(raw_type_list l);
type_p make_union_type(raw_type_list l);
@)
raw_type_list make_type_singleton(type_p raw);
raw_type_list make_type_list(raw_type_list l,type_p t);

@ The functions like |mk_prim| below simply call the constructor in the
context of the operator |new|, and then capture of the resulting (raw) pointer
into a |type_ptr| result. The functions like |make_prim| wrap them for the
parser interface, undressing the pointers to raw again. Using this setup it is
ensured that all pointers are considered owning their target, implicitly so
while being manipulated by the parser (which guarantees that every pointer
placed on the parsing stack will be argument of an interface function exactly
once, possibly some |destroy| function in case it pops symbols during error
recovery).

The first group of functions makes some provisions to facilitate special
relations between types, so that the parser does not have to deal with them.
Thus |mk_prim_type| will return an empty tuple type when called with the type
name for |"void"|, although this is not a primitive type (indeed |"void"|
should probably better be handled just like user-defined type abbreviations).
The function |mk_union_type| will not encapsulate a list of length one into an
invalid |type_expr|, but rather return its unique list element, unpacked. The
reason for this is that having a syntactic category for a list of at least one
component separated by vertical bars simplifies the grammar considerably; when
the list has one component (and no bars) a union of one variant is temporarily
created, but upon incorporation into an encompassing type, the union is then
removed again. For tuples a similar provision is not necessary, as a somewhat
more involved set of grammar rules is used that avoids making type lists of
length~$1$.

The functions |make_tuple_type| and |make_union_type| reverse the list of
types they handle, to compensate for the fact that the left-recursive grammar
rules (easier for the parser generator) construct their type lists in reverse
order.

@*1 Specifying types by strings.
%
In practice we shall rarely call functions like |mk_prim_type| and
|mk_row_type| directly to make explicit types, since this is rather laborious.
Instead, such explicit types will be constructed by the function |mk_type|
that parses a (\Cee~type) string, and correspondingly calls the appropriate
type constructing functions.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
type_ptr mk_type(const char* s);
type_expr mk_type_expr(const char* s);
  // ``exported'' for our global variable initialisation

@ The task of converting a properly formatted string into a type is one of
parsing a simple kind of expressions. The strings used here come from string
denotations in the source code (mostly in calls installing built-in functions
into \.{axis}) rather than from user input, and we are not going to write
incorrect strings (we hope). Therefore we don't care if the error handling is
crude here. The simplest way of parsing ``by hand'' is recursive descent, so
that is what we shall use. By passing a character pointer by reference, we
allow the recursive calls to advance the index within the string read.

The function |scan_type| does the real parsing, |mk_type_expr| calls it,
providing a local modifiable pointer to bind to its reference parameter (which
is important because |scan_type| cannot directly accept a \Cee-string constant
as argument) while also doing error reporting, and |mk_type| is just a wrapper
around |mk_type_expr| that converts the result from a |type_expr| to a smart
pointer to (a freshly allocated instance of) such. Currently the function
|mk_type_expr| is called only during the start-up phase of \.{atlas}, and if an
error is encountered (of type |logic_error|, since this must be an error in
the \.{atlas} program itself), printing of the error message will be followed
by termination of the program.

@< Function definitions @>=
type_expr scan_in_parens(const char*& s);
type_expr scan_union_list(const char*& s);
type_expr scan_tuple_list(const char*& s);
@)
type_expr scan_type(const char*& s)
{ if (*s=='(')
  { type_expr result=scan_in_parens(++s);
    if (*s++!=')')
      throw logic_error("Missing ')' in type");
    return result;
  }
  else if (*s=='[')
  {
    type_ptr p(new type_expr(scan_in_parens(++s)));
    if (*s++!=']')
      throw logic_error("Missing ']' in type");
    return type_expr(std::move(p));
  }
  else if (*s=='*') return ++s,@[type_expr()@]; // undetermined type
  else @< Scan and |return| a primitive type, or |throw| a |logic_error| @>
}
@)
type_expr mk_type_expr(const char* s)
{ const char* orig=s;
  try
  {@; return scan_type(s); }
  catch (logic_error e)
  { std::cerr << e.what() << "; original string: '" << orig @|
              << "' text remaining: '" << s << "'\n";
    throw@[@];
  // make the error hard to ignore; if thrown probably aborts the program
  }
}
@)
type_ptr mk_type(const char* s)
{@; return type_ptr(new type_expr(mk_type_expr(s))); }
  // wrap up |type_expr| in |type_ptr|


@ For primitive types we use the same strings as for printing them. We test as
many characters as the type name has, and the fact that no alphanumeric
character follows, so that a longer type name will not match a prefix of it.

In this module we use the fact that the order in the list |prim_names| matches
that in the enumeration type |primitive_tag|, by casting the integer index
into the former list to an element of that enumeration.

@h <cstring> // |strlen|, |strncmp|
@h <cctype> // |isalpha|
@< Scan and |return| a primitive type, or |throw| a |logic_error| @>=
{ for (size_t i=0; i<nr_of_primitive_types; ++i)
  { const char* name=prim_names[i];
    size_t l= std::strlen(name);
    if (std::strncmp(s,name,l)==0 and not isalpha(s[l]))
    { s+=l;
      primitive_tag tag = static_cast<primitive_tag>(i);
      if (tag == nr_of_primitive_types) // then name scanned was |"void"|
        return type_expr(empty_tuple()); // which is equivalent to |"()"|
      return type_expr(tag); // otherwise this is a true primitive type
    }
  }
  throw logic_error("Type unrecognised");
}

@ The following code demonstrates how simple recursive descent parsing can be.

The function |scan_in_parens| scans a maximal portion of a type string that is
enclosed in parentheses or brackets. It only deals directly with an arrow that
might separate argument and return type in a function type (but might of
course be absent), and relies on |scan_union_list| to recognise the first and
possibly the second part. The function recognises one or more variants
separated by vertical bars (using a |while| loop but which uses a comma
operator to scan a variant before the loop condition), relying on its turn on
|scan_tuple_list| to deal with individual variants. It must take care though
to unpack the list in case it has length one (no union is involved in this
case). Finally |scan_tuple_list| similarly combines components in a list,
recursively calling |scan_type| for individual components. Unlike unions, we
allow the number of components to be zero, which can be recognised by having a
terminating character at the read position right from the start; when the
happens the loop is no entered at all, an the empty list of components will
give an empty tuple.

@< Function definitions @>=
type_expr scan_in_parens(const char*& s)
{ type_expr a=scan_union_list(s);
  if (*s!='-' or s[1]!='>')
    return a;
  return type_expr(std::move(a),scan_union_list(s+=2));
    // construct function type

      ++s;
  return members.size()==1
    ? std::move(members.front())
    : type_expr(members.undress(),false);
}

@*1 Predefined type expressions.
%
We shall often need to refer to certain types for comparison or for providing
a required type context. Instead of generating them on the fly each time using
|mk_type|, we define constant values that can be used everywhere.

@< Declarations of global variables @>=
extern const type_expr unknown_type; // \.{*}
extern const type_expr void_type; // \.{()}
extern const type_expr int_type; // \.{int}
extern const type_expr bool_type; // \.{bool}
extern const type_expr row_of_type; // \.{[*]}
extern const type_expr gen_func_type; // \.{(*->*)}

@ In some cases we need temporary copies of |void_type|, |int_type| and
|bool_type| to be used in the position of a modifiable lvalue argument. In
order to provide these temporary copies as arguments without having to bind
them to named variables, we define a function template that will produce a
modifiable lvalue from the modifiable rvalue, such as the result of calling
the |expr::copy| method.

@< Template and inline... @>=
template<typename T> T& as_lvalue(T&& rvalue) @+{@; return rvalue; }

@ The definition of the variables uses the constructors we have seen above, or
calls to |mk_type_expr|, rather than functions like |mk_prim_type| and
|mk_row_type|, so that no dynamic allocation is required for the top level
structure.

@< Global variable definitions @>=

@: first types section @>

const type_expr unknown_type; // uses default constructor
const type_expr void_type(empty_tuple());
const type_expr int_type(integral_type);
const type_expr bool_type(boolean_type);
const type_expr row_of_type(mk_type_expr("[*]"));
const type_expr gen_func_type(mk_type_expr("(*->*)"));

@ There are more such statically allocated type expressions, which are used in
the evaluator. They are less fundamental, as they are not actually used in any
of the core language constructs, but useful for instance for specifying
various coercions. The definition of these constants therefore might be moved
to another compilation unit, but they are defined here so that in case their
initialisation should use other such constants, the order of initialisation
will be controlled (this is not the case between initialisations in different
compilation unit, which can lead to the so-called static initialisation
fiasco; indeed at some point we had for these constants a subtle bug whose
appearance depended on the precise compiler version used).

@< Declarations of global variables @>=
extern const type_expr rat_type; // \.{rat}
extern const type_expr str_type; // \.{string}
extern const type_expr vec_type; // \.{vec}

extern const type_expr mat_type; // \.{mat}

extern const type_expr split_type; // \.{Split}
extern const type_expr param_type; // \.{RealForm}
extern const type_expr param_pol_type; // \.{RealForm}

@ The definitions below have all become self-contained, due to the use of
|mk_type_expr| for non-primitive types. Indeed, since we cannot have sharing
between type (sub-)expressions, the economy of using the |copy| method for
previously constructed type constants would be truly marginal. So in their
current form, some of these definitions could now (again) be moved to other
compilation units, where they might even be just local constants.

@< Function definitions @>=
type_expr unknown_tuple(size_t n)
{ type_list tl;
  while (n-->0)
    prefix(type_expr(),tl);
  return type_expr(std::move(tl));
}

@* Run-time values.
%
Now we shall consider run-time values. As we mentioned before, the interpreter
must access values via generic pointers in order to be able to manipulate them
regardless of their types, which could be arbitrarily complicated. We could
either use void pointers to represent generic values and cast them when
necessary, or use inheritance and the dynamic cast feature of \Cpp. We choose
the second option, which is quite convenient to use, although this means that in
reality we have dynamic type information stored within the values, even though
that information had already been determined during type analysis. We shall in
fact use this information to double-check our type analysis at run time.

@< Includes needed in \.{axis-types.h} @>=
#include <iostream> // needed for specification of |print| method below

@~We start with a base class for values. For it to be an abstract class, there
must be at least one pure virtual function in the class; the destructor having
to be virtual anyway, we make it pure virtual (this does not mean it is
unimplemented, in fact it must be implemented as it will always be called,
after the destructor for a derived class; it just means derived
classes \emph{must} override the default). The printing function does not have
a useful default, so we make it pure virtual as well, without providing an
implementation (in the base class). This |print| method will demonstrate the
ease of using dynamic typing via inheritance; it will not do any dynamic
casting, but other operations on values will.

Apart from virtual methods, we define other methods that will be redefined in
all or some derived classes, and which are selected based on the static type at
hand in the calling code rather than on the dynamic type, as the former will be
known to match the latter due to our type system. The method |name| is used in
reporting logic errors from function templates, notably the failure of a value
to be of the predicted type, where |name| names that predicted type. Since
callers are functions that know the type (via a template argument) but need not
have any object of that type at hand, we define |name| to be a |static|. For
certain derived types there will be operations implemented by making changes to
an existing value; we use copy-on-write when our reference to the initial value
is shared, and these derived classes provide a (usually default) copy
constructor, which will be invoked by the |get_own| function template below. It
used to call a virtual |clone| method, but that forces \emph{all} derived
classes to implement copying, while in the current situation those that do not
use |get_own| may simply not implement copying by deleting the copy constructor.

We disable assignment of |value_base| objects, since they
should always be handled by reference; the base class is abstract anyway, but
this ensures us that for no derived class an implicitly defined assignment
operator is accidentally invoked. Though derived copy constructors will be
|private|, they need to copy the base object, so we provide a |protected| copy
constructor.

Values are always handled via pointers. The raw pointer type is |value|, and a
shared smart pointer-to-constant is |shared_value|. The const-ness of the
latter reflects a copy-on-write policy: we rarely need to modify values
in-place, but when we do, we ensure our shared pointer is actually unique, and
then |const_cast| it to a derived version of |own_value| for modification (this
will be hidden in a function template defined later).

@< Type definitions @>=
struct value_base
{ value_base() @+ {}
@/virtual ~value_base() = 0;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const =0;
@)
// |static const char* name();| just a model; defined in derived classes
@)
  value_base& operator=(const value_base& x) = @[delete@];
};
inline value_base::~value_base() @+{} // necessary but empty implementation
@)
typedef const value_base* value;
typedef std::shared_ptr<const value_base> shared_value;
typedef std::shared_ptr<value_base> own_value;

@ We can already make sure that the operator~`|<<|' will do the right thing
for any of our values.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const value_base& v);

@~The operator~`|<<|' handles calling the virtual |print| method of the actual
value as usual.

@< Function definitions @>=
std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const value_base& v)
{@; v.print(out); return out; }

@*1 Row-of values.
%
Here we define a first type derived from |value_base|, namely the type for
``row of'' types. They are implemented using vectors from the standard
template library.

@< Includes needed in \.{axis-types.h} @>=
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>

@~Since the actual values accessed will be of types derived from |value_base|,
we must pass through a level of indirection, so we have a vector of pointers. We
define these pointers to be |shared_value| pointers, so that the row takes
(shared) ownership of its components without needing an explicit destructor.
This has the additional advantage over explicit ownership management that the
copy constructor can safely just copy-construct the vector of pointers: a
possible exception thrown during the copy is guaranteed to clean up any pointers
present in the vector (resetting their reference counts to their original
values). Note also that default-constructed shared pointers are set to null
pointers, so the first constructor below, which just reserves space for |n|
shared pointers, has set them to exception-safe values while waiting for the
slots to be filled.

Of course ownership of pointers to |row_value| objects also needs to be managed.
The type |own_row| will be used after constructing the row while filling in the
contents, or after ensuring unique ownership of the row in order to perform
destructive operations (so although a |shared_ptr<value_base>|, it is known to
actually be unique); at all other times the pointer converted to |shared_row|
(and possibly down-cast to |shared_value|) will be used.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct row_value : public value_base
{ std::vector<shared_value> val;
@)
  explicit row_value(size_t n) : val(n) @+{} // start with |n| null pointers
  template <typename I> row_value(I begin, I end) : val(begin,end)
    @+{} // set from iterator range
  void print(std::ostream& out) const;
  size_t length() const @+{@; return val.size(); }
  static const char* name() @+{@; return "row value"; }
  row_value @[(const row_value& ) = default@];
    // we use |get_own<row_value>|
};
@)
typedef std::shared_ptr<const row_value> shared_row;
typedef std::shared_ptr<row_value> own_row;

@ So here is the first occasion where we shall use virtual functions. For the
moment the output routine performs an immediate recursion; later we shall try
to make this more elegant by computing the width needed to output component
values, and adapt the formatting to that.

@< Function definitions @>=
void row_value::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ out << '[';
  for (auto it=val.begin(); it!=val.end(); ++it)
    out << (it==val.begin() ? "" : ",") << **it;
   out << ']';
}


@*1 Tuple values.
%
Since we use dynamically typed values internally, we can collect the
components of a tuple in a vector without problem. In fact we could reuse the
type |row_value| to hold the components of a tuple, if it weren't for the fact
that it would then print with brackets. Therefore we trivially derive a new
class from |row_value|.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct tuple_value : public row_value
{ tuple_value(size_t n) : row_value(n) @+{}
  template <typename I> tuple_value(I begin, I end) : row_value(begin,end) @+{}
  void print(std::ostream& out) const;
  static const char* name() @+{@; return "tuple value"; }
@/tuple_value @[(const tuple_value& ) = default@];
    // we use |uniquify<tuple_value>|
};
@)
typedef std::unique_ptr<tuple_value> tuple_ptr;
typedef std::shared_ptr<const tuple_value> shared_tuple;
typedef std::shared_ptr<tuple_value> own_tuple;

@ We just need to redefine the |print| method.
@< Function definitions @>=
void tuple_value::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ out << '(';
  for (auto it=val.begin(); it!=val.end(); ++it)
    out << (it==val.begin() ? "" : ",") << **it;
   out << ')';
}

@ Here are functions that pack and unpack tuples from values on the stack, in
terms of the operations |push_value| and |pop_value| defined in sections
@# Push execution stack @> and @# Pop execution stack @> below.
They will be used by wrapper functions around functions from the Atlas
library, and in the case of |wrap_tuple| for the evaluation of tuple
expressions. The function |push_tuple_components| will be called by wrapper
functions that need the tuple components on the stack; the function call
|wrap_tuple(n)| inversely builds a tuple from $n$ components on the stack.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
void push_tuple_components();
void wrap_tuple(size_t n);

@~These functions use the same convention for stack order: the last tuple
component is on top of the stack. In |push_tuple_components| we start by
popping a value and checking it to be a tuple, which is done by
|get<tuple_value>| that will be defined later. The |shared_value| type takes
care of ownership; there is (at least) double shared ownership of the
components as the stack expands, but this is normal, and afterwards this
sharing disappears with the destruction of |tuple|.

@< Function definitions @>=
void push_tuple_components()
{ shared_tuple tuple=get<tuple_value>();
  for (size_t i=0; i<tuple->length(); ++i)
    push_value(tuple->val[i]); // push component
}

@ Wrapping a tuple is a simple matter of allocating a |tuple_value| of the
proper size, and then filling it from back to front with shared values popped
from the stack. This was the first place in the Atlas software where a
descending loop using an unsigned loop variable was used; this requires a
post-decrement operation in the test so as to stop \emph{after} handling the
value~$0$. Similar loops can now be found all over the place, and they could
be even more ubiquitous if would have chosen to sacrifice readability for speed
by preferring decreasing loops to increasing ones whenever there is a choice:
the decreasing variant can be slightly more efficient then its increasing
equivalent, because a test against~$0$ can be more efficient than a test
against another value, especially one not known at compile time.

The concrete loop below will however only be invoked for tuples constructed
according to the user program. For uses where an explicit value of $n$ is
known, as happens when called internally from a wrapper function, we provide a
templated version of |wrap_tuple| in section@#templated wrap_tuple section@>,
and that version does not involve a loop at all.

@< Function definitions @>=
void wrap_tuple(size_t n)
{ std::shared_ptr<tuple_value> result = std::make_shared<tuple_value>(n);
  while (n-->0) // standard idiom; not |(--n>=0)|, since |n| is unsigned!
    result->val[n] =pop_value();
  push_value(std::move(result));
}

@*1 Union values.
%
Formally discriminated unions are in a sense dual to Cartesian products, but
the concrete implementation is fairly different. We must just store an
indication (a tag) of the variant of the union that is actually taken in the
value at hand, and then the component value itself. Since it usually takes
only a few bits to represent the tag, and pointers (especially $64$-bit ones)
have some room to spare, it is tempting to somehow cram the tag bits into a
pointer value and avoid an extra level of dereference. However if we want
orthogonality of the language (the component can be any value, including a
union) there is just no way to elegantly do this, so we store a structure with
a tag and a pointer. We take advantage of padding space this would probably
leave in the structure, and also add the name of the injector function that
was used to produce this value, which will be used for printing purposes only.

@< Type definitions @>=
class union_value : public value_base
{ shared_value comp;
  unsigned short tag;
  id_type injector_name;
public:
  union_value(unsigned short tag,shared_value&& v,id_type name) :
     comp(std::move(v)),tag(tag),injector_name(name) @+{}
  unsigned int variant() const @+{@; return tag; }
  const shared_value& contents() const @+{@; return comp; }
  void print(std::ostream& out) const;
  static const char* name() @+{@; return "union value"; }
  union_value @[(const union_value& v) = delete@];
};
@)
typedef std::unique_ptr<union_value> union_ptr;
typedef std::shared_ptr<const union_value> shared_union;
typedef std::shared_ptr<union_value> own_union;

@ The |print| method for unions will print the value, followed by a dot and
the injector name.

@h "lexer.h" // for |main_hash_table|
@< Function definitions @>=
void union_value::print(std::ostream& out) const
{@; out << *comp << '.' << main_hash_table->name_of(injector_name); }


@*1 Representation of an evaluation context.
%
While evaluating user programs, values will be given to local identifiers such
as arguments of functions being called. The identification of identifiers is
determined during type analysis (static binding); it results for local
identifiers in a method to locate the associated value in the evaluation
context, which is formed of a stack of frames, each holding a vector of
values.

One of the methods for our frame type will produce a back insert iterator, so
we need the following include in order to declare it.

@< Includes needed... @>=
#include <iterator>

@~Frames are actually allocated on the heap, and their lifetimes do not follow
a stack regime unless a very limited use is made of user-defined functions
(never passing such a function as value out of the expression in which it was
defined), so it is better to just say they are linked lists of frames. A
singly linked list suffices, and by using shared pointers as links,
destruction of frames once inaccessible is automatic.

@s back_insert_iterator vector

@< Type definitions @>=
typedef std::shared_ptr<class evaluation_context> shared_context;
class evaluation_context
{ shared_context next;
  std::vector<shared_value> frame;
  evaluation_context@[(const evaluation_context&) = delete@];
  // never copy contexts
public:
  evaluation_context (const shared_context& next)
@/: next(next), frame() @+{}
  void reserve (size_t n) @+{@; frame.reserve(n); }
  shared_value& elem(size_t i,size_t j);
  std::back_insert_iterator<std::vector<shared_value> > back_inserter ()
  {@; return std::back_inserter(frame); }
  const shared_context& tail() const @+{@; return next; }
  std::vector<shared_value>::const_iterator begin() const
    @+{@; return frame.begin(); }
  std::vector<shared_value>::const_iterator end() const
    @+{@; return frame.end(); }
};

@ The method |evaluation_context::elem| descends the stack and then selects a
value from the proper frame.

@< Function def... @>=
shared_value& evaluation_context::elem(size_t i, size_t j)
{
  evaluation_context* p=this;
  while (i-->0 and (p=p->next.get())!=nullptr) {}
  assert(p!=nullptr and j<p->frame.size());
@/return p->frame[j];
}

@* Values representing type-checked expressions.
%
The parser is a \Cpp-program that upon success returns a value of type |expr|
representing the parse tree. While analysing this expression for
type-correctness, it will be convenient to transform it into a value that can
be efficiently evaluated. This value will be a pointer to an object of one of
a number of classes derived, most often directly, from an empty base class (in
the same way as runtime values are pointers to an object of a class derived
from |value_base|), which classes have a virtual method |evaluate| that
performs the operation described by the expression. We shall now define the
base class.

A fundamental choice is whether to make the result type of the |evaluate| type
equal to |value|. Although this would seem the natural choice, we prefer
to make its result |void|, and to handle all value-passing via an execution
stack; thus we hope to be able to avoid packing and unpacking of tuple values
in most cases when calling functions. In order to do that effectively, we
dynamically pass a parameter to the |evaluate| method telling whether the
result is expected to be ``expanded'' on the runtime stack in case it is of a
tuple type.

@ Since our |evaluate| methods will put values on the execution stack, let us
declare it right away. We decide that values on the execution stack can be
shared with other values (for instance when the user subscripts a row, vector
or matrix bound to an identifier, it would be wasteful to duplicate that
entire structure just so that it can briefly reside on the execution stack),
whence we use |shared_value| smart pointers in the stack.

This choice will have consequences in many places in the evaluator, since once a
value is referred to by such a smart pointer, its ownership cannot be
transferred to any other regime; when strict ownership should be needed, the
only option would be to make a copy. However, it turns out to be convenient
to \emph{always} use shared pointers for runtime values, and to make the
distinction concerning whether one knows this pointer to be unique by having its
type be pointer-to-non-const in that case. After construction or duplication one
can start out with such a pointer, use it to store the proper value, then
convert it pointer-to-const (i.e., |shared_value|), for handing on the stack and
passing around in general; if destructive access is needed one may reconvert to
pointer-to-non-const after having checked unique ownership (or else having
duplicated the value pointed to).

@< Declarations of global variables @>=
extern std::vector<shared_value> execution_stack;

@~We define the stack as a static variable of this compilation unit; it is
initially empty. All usable built-in functions will be provided with a small
wrapper function that takes it values from the stack and places its results
there again. Parameters are placed on the stack in order, and should therefore
be popped from the stack in reverse order.

@< Global variable definitions @>=

@ Sometimes we may need to expand a value into tuple components separately
pushed onto the stack, but only if the |level l@;| so indicates and the value
is indeed of tuple type; the function |push_expanded| will help doing this.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
void push_expanded(expression_base::level l, const shared_value& v);

@~Type information is not retained in compiled expression values, so
|push_expanded| cannot know which type had been found for |v| (moreover,
|push_expanded| is typically called for arguments for which the type is not
determined at \.{atlas} compile time). But it can use a dynamic
cast do determine whether |v| actually is a tuple value or not.

@* Some useful function templates.
%
We now define some inline functions to facilitate manipulating the stack. The
function |push_value| does what its name suggests. For exception safety it
takes a shared pointer as argument. The former form used to take an |auto_ptr|
argument by value, which allowed both to transfer ownership from an lvalue
(i.e., a variable) of the same type, and to bind to an rvalue (for instance
the result of a function). With the change to a representation as |unique_ptr|
instance, the lvalue argument case would no longer bind as-is, and an
invocation of |std::move| had to be inserted into the code in more than~$60$
places for this reason (the rvalue case does not need modification). The
argument passing was also changed to modifiable rvalue reference, with the
same syntactic obligations for the caller; this avoids one transfer of
ownership, doing so only when the pointer is converted to a |shared_ptr| in
the code below. Finally it was realised that there is no advantage to first
creating a unique pointer, so we now always create a shared pointer for values
that will be pushed onto the stack using the |std::make_shared| template
function. This can either be in the argument expression of |push_value|, in
cases where the object pushed can be constructed in place to its definite
value, or earlier (the result of |std::make_shared| being held by shared
pointer to non~|const|, that is, convertible to |own_value|) if the
constructed object needs modification before being pushed. In both cases the
rvalue reference version of |push_value| will be used (in the latter case by
wrapping the |own_value| in |std::move|), which avoids any manipulation of
reference counts; the constant lvalue reference case is used only in the rare
cases (as in |push_tuple_components| above) where a pre-existing
|shared_value| not held in a local variable is being pushed.

@: Push execution stack @>

@< Template and inline function definitions @>=
inline void push_value(const shared_value& v)
  @+{@; execution_stack.push_back(v); }

inline void push_value(shared_value&& v)
  @+{@; execution_stack.push_back(std::move(v)); }

@ There is a counterpart |pop_value| to |push_value|. By move-constructing
from the stack top just before it is popped, we avoid incrementing and then
immediately decrementing the |use_count| value.

@< Template and inline function definitions @>=

inline shared_value pop_value()
{@; shared_value arg(std::move(execution_stack.back()));
  execution_stack.pop_back();
  return arg;
}

@ Most often the result of calling |pop_value| must be dynamically cast to the
type it is known to have (by the type check that was passed); should such a
cast fail, this reveals a flaw of our type system, so we throw a
|logic_error|. The function template |get| with explicitly provided type
serves for this purpose; it returns a shared pointer (because values on the
stack are shared pointers) of the proper kind.

Sometimes defeating copy-on-write is desired (to allow changes like filling
internal tables that will \emph{benefit} other shareholders), and
|non_const_get| will const-cast the result of |get| to allow that.

@< Template and inline function definitions @>=

template <typename D> // |D| is a type derived from |value_base|
 inline std::shared_ptr<const D> get()
{ std::shared_ptr<const D> p=std::dynamic_pointer_cast<const D>(pop_value());
  if (p.get()==nullptr)
    throw logic_error() << "Argument is no " << D::name();
  return p;
}
@.Argument is no ...@>

@)
template <typename D> // |D| is a type derived from |value_base|
  inline std::shared_ptr<D> non_const_get()
{@; return std::const_pointer_cast<D>(get<D>()); }

@ Here is a function template similar to |get|, that applies in situations
where the value whose type is known does not reside on the stack. As for |get|
we convert using a |dynamic_cast|, and to throw a |logic_error| in case our
type prediction was wrong. This function is defined at the level of ordinary
pointers, and it is not intended for use where the caller assumes ownership of
the result; the original pointer is assumed to retain ownership as long as the
result of this call survives, and in particular that pointer should probably
not be obtained by calling the |get| method for a smart pointer temporary, nor
should the result of |force| converted to a smart pointer, lest double
deletion would ensue.

We provide two versions, where overloading will choose one or the other
depending on the const-ness of the argument. Since calling |get| for a
|shared_value| pointer returns a |value| (which is pointer to constant), it
will often be the second one that is selected.

@< Template and inline function definitions @>=
template <typename D> // |D| is a type derived from |value_base|
  D* force (value_base* v)
{ D* p=dynamic_cast<D*>(v);
  if (p==nullptr) throw
    logic_error() <<"forced value is no " << D::name();
  return p;
}
@)
template <typename D> // |D| is a type derived from |value_base|
  const D* force (value v)
{ const D* p=dynamic_cast<const D*>(v);
  if (p==nullptr) throw
    logic_error() << "forced value is no " << D::name();
  return p;
}

@ The \.{axis} language allows assignment operations to components of aggregates
(such as rows, matrices, strings, tuples), which in fact assign a new value to
the name bound to the aggregate. Since we implement copy-on-write, this should
in principle make a copy of the aggregate before modifying the component, but
the copy can be avoided if the aggregate value is unshared. The operation
|uniquify| implements making a copy if necessary, and calling it makes clear our
destructive intentions. If copying is necessary we invoke the copy constructor
via |std::make_shared|, and |uniquify| is templated by the actual derived type
to specify which copy constructor to use. This also allows us to export a
pointer to that derived type. We give |uniquify| a modifiable lvalue
|shared_value| (shared pointer-to-const) argument, to which a new shared (but
currently unique) pointer will be assigned in case duplication was necessary,
and it returns a raw pointer-to-non-const, which can then be used to make the
change to the unique copy. The argument |v| retains ownership. Not surprisingly
the implementation of |uniquify| uses a |const_cast| operation when no
duplication takes place.

@< Template and inline function def... @>=
template <typename D> // |D| is a type derived from |value_base|
  D* uniquify(shared_value& v)
{ const D* p = force<D>(v.get());
  if (v.unique())
    return const_cast<D*>(p); // we can now safely write to |*p|
  auto result = std::make_shared<D>(*p);
    // invokes copy constructor; assumes it exists for |D|
  v = result; // upcast and constify (temporarily duplicates shared pointer)
  return result.get();
    // now |v| retains unique shared pointer, but we can modify its target
}

@ Similarly some wrapper functions will want to get unique access to an argument
object, so that they can return a modified version of it as result. This
requires taking an argument pointer from the stack, and duplicating the argument
value if the pointer has |use_count()>1| (a rare circumstance, since most
functions that place a value on the stack will do so with fresh pointer from
|std::make_shared|). We provide a variant function template of |get| called
|get_own|, that operates like |uniquify| except that ownership is not retained
by an external object, but by the result from |get_own| which therefore is a
shared pointer (but guaranteed to be unique at return). It uses a
|std::const_pointer_cast| in the case where no copy is made.

Finally there is |force_own|, which is similar to |get_own| but takes its value
not from the stack but from some other place that will not retain ownership;
like for |get_own| ownership passes to the result, which is a shared (but
unique) pointer to non-|const| for the derived type. In order for this to work,
the original copy of the pointer must be cleared at the time |unique| is called,
so that this call has some chance of returning |true|. To the end we take the
argument as rvalue reference, and make sure a temporary is move-constructed from
it inside the body of |force_own|; the temporary is constructed in the argument
to |std::dynamic_pointer_cast| (which has no overloads that directly bind to,
and upon success move from, and rvalue argument; our work-around moves from the
rvalue even if the dynamic cast fails, but then we throw a |logic_error|
anyway).

Since these functions return pointers that are guaranteed to be unique, one
might wonder why no use of |std::unique_ptr| is made. The answer is this is
not possible, since there is no way to persuade a |shared_ptr| to release its
ownership (as in the |release| method of unique pointers), even if it happens
to be (or is known to be) the unique owner.

@< Template and inline function def... @>=
template <typename D> // |D| is a type derived from |value_base|
  std::shared_ptr<D> get_own()
{ std::shared_ptr<const D> p=get<D>();
  if (p.unique())
    return std::const_pointer_cast<D>(p);
  return std::make_shared<D>(*p);
    // invokes copy constructor; assumes it exists for |D|
}
@)
template <typename D> // |D| is a type derived from |value_base|
  std::shared_ptr<D> force_own(shared_value&& q)
{ std::shared_ptr<const D> p=
     std::dynamic_pointer_cast<const D>(shared_value(std::move(q)));
  if (p==nullptr) throw
    logic_error() << "forced value is no " << D::name();
  if (p.unique())
    return std::const_pointer_cast<D>(p);
  return std::make_shared<D>(*p); // invokes copy constructor; assumes it exists
}

@ The argument~$n$ to |wrap_tuple| most often is a compile time constant, so
we give a templated version that can be completely unrolled by the compiler.

@* Implicit conversion of values between types.
%
When interfacing this generic interpreter with a concrete library such as that
of the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations, a mechanism must be provided
to convert data in the interpreter (represented essentially as nested lists)
into the internal format of the library. For transparency of this mechanism we
have chosen to provide the conversion through implicit operations that are
accompanied by type changes; thus when the user enters a list of lists of
integers in a position where an integral matrix is required, the necessary
conversions are automatically inserted during type analysis. In fact we shall
put in place a general mechanism of automatic type conversions, which will for
instance also provide the inverse conversions where appropriate, and on some
occasions merely provides convenience to the user, for instance by allowing
integers in positions where rational numbers are required.

The function |coerce| requires two fully determined types |from_type| and
|to_type|, and its final argument~|e| is a reference to the previously
converted expression. If a conversion of value of |from_type| to |to_type| is
available, then |coerce| will modify |e| by insertion of a conversion around
it; the return value of |coerce| indicates whether an applicable conversion
was found. The function |conform_types| first tries to specialise the type
|required| to the one |found|, and if this fails tries to coerce |found| to
|required|, in the latter case enveloping the translated expression |d| in the
applied conversion function; if both fail an error mentioning the
expression~|e| is thrown.

The function |row_coercion| specialises if possible |row_variant| in such a
way that the corresponding row type can be coerced to |final_type|, and
returns a pointer to the |conversion_record| for the coercion in question. The
function |coercion| serves for filling the coercion table.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=

bool coerce(const type_expr& from_type, const type_expr& to_type,
            expression_ptr& e);
expression_ptr conform_types
  (const type_expr& found, type_expr& required
  , expression_ptr&& d, const expr& e);
const conversion_record* row_coercion(const type_expr& final_type,
				     type_expr& component_type);
void coercion(const type_expr& from,
              const type_expr& to,
              const char* s, conversion_info::conv_f f);

@ We shall derive a single class |conversion| from |expression_base| to
represent any expression that is to be converted using one of the various
conversions. Which conversion is to be applied is determined by
|conversion_type|, a reference to a |conversion_info| structure containing a
function pointer |convert| that provides the actual conversion routine; this
is easier than deriving a plethora of classes differing only in their virtual
method |evaluate|, although it is slightly less efficient. The type |conv_f|
of conversion function pointer specifies no argument or return value, as we
know beforehand that the |shared_value| objects serving for this are to be
found and left on the runtime stack.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct conversion_info
{ typedef void (*conv_f)();
  conv_f convert;
  std::string name;
  conversion_info(const char* s,conv_f c) : convert(c),name(s) @+{}

@)
class conversion : public expression_base

  conversion(const conversion_info& t,expression_ptr e)
@/: conversion_type(t),exp(std::move(e)) @+{}
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ The |evaluate| method for conversions dispatches to the |convert| member,
after evaluating |exp|. The |level| argument is not passed to the |convert|
function, which will always replace a value on the stack by a single other
value. There is a language design decision implicit in this implementation:
there are no implicit conversions that return a tuple type. In fact we tried
some such conversions, for instance from a rational number (and later from a
split integer) to a pair of integers, and this was unsatisfactory even when
correctly implemented. One reason is that it disturbs operator and function
overloading: one can no longer define operators for the converted-from type if
the operator or function already exists for the tuple type converted to; for
instance one could not define unary minus for rational numbers because binary
minus for integers was already defined. Another reason is that using
decomposition of tuples in a let-expression to disassemble the converted-from
type will not work without a cast to a specific tuple type, since in this
context the mere desire to have some unspecified tuple does not suffice to
activate the implicit conversion. For these reasons it is preferable to always
have the conversion to a tuple be an explicit function.

Although automatic conversions are only inserted when the type analysis
requires a non-empty result type, it is still possible that at run time this
method is called with |l==no_value|, so we do cater for that here. The case is
fairly rare, so we don't mind the inefficiency of performing the conversion
and then discarding the result; this will allow a failing conversion to be
signalled as an error in such cases.

@*1 Coercion of types.
%
An important aspect of automatic conversions is that they can be applied in
situations where the result type and only part of the source type is known:
for instance one can be inserted when a list display occurs in a context
requiring a vector, because no row type equals the (primitive) vector type.
While this use requires particular consideration according to the syntactic
form of the expression (list display), there is also a simpler form of
automatic conversion that can be applied to a large variety of expressions
(identifiers, function calls, \dots) whenever they are found to have a
different type from what the context requires. The function |coerce| will
try to insert an automatic conversion in such situations, if this can resolve
the type conflict. We present this mechanism first, since the table it employs
can then be re-used to handle the more subtle cases of automatic conversions.

@ The implementation of |coerce| will be determined by a simple table lookup.
The records in this table contain a |conversion_info| structure (in fact they
are derived from it) and in addition indications of the types converted from
and to. Since these types occur in a small fixed collection of types, all of
which are statically created in sections @# first types section @> and~%
@# second types section @>, the type expressions are not stored in the table
itself, which instead stores non-owning pointers to them.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct conversion_record : public conversion_info
{ const type_expr* from, * to;
  // non-owned pointers, themselves could be |const| in gcc 4.8
  conversion_record @| (const type_expr& from_type,
                     const type_expr& to_type,
                     const char* s, conv_f c)
   : conversion_info(s,c), from(&from_type),to(&to_type) @+{}
};

@ Here is the lookup table. It is defined as vector so that other compilation
units can extend it; however it should not be extended once evaluation starts,
since |conversion| objects will store references to table entries, which would
become invalid in case of reallocation.

@< Global variable definitions @>=

std::vector<conversion_record> coerce_table;

@ The function |coercion| simplifies filling the coercion table; it is
externally callable. Its action is simply extending |coerce_table| with a new
|conversion_record|.
@< Function def... @>=
void coercion(const type_expr& from,
              const type_expr& to,
              const char* s, conversion_info::conv_f f)
{@; coerce_table.emplace_back(from,to,s,f); }

@ There is one coercion that is not stored in the lookup table, since it can
operate on any input type: the ``voiding'' coercion. It can be applied during
type analysis to for instance to allow a conditional expression in a void
context to have branches that evaluate to different types (including the
possibility of absent branches which will be taken to deliver an empty tuple):
those branches which do not already have void type will get their resulting
value voided, so that in the end all branches share the void type of the
entire conditional.

At runtime, voiding is mostly taken care of by the |level| argument~|l| passed
around in the evaluation mechanism. Any subexpressions with imposed void type,
like the expression before the semicolon in a sequence expression, will get
their |evaluate| method called with |l==no_value|, which suppresses the
production of any value on the |execution_stack|. This setting will be
inherited down to for instance the branches, if the subexpression was a
conditional, so nothing special needs to be done to ensure that branches which
originally had non-void type get voided. However, there are some rare cases
where the void type does not derive from the syntactic nature of the context,
such as in the right hand side of an assignment to a variable that happens to
have |void| type (a quite useless but valid operation). In these cases the
type analysis will have to explicitly insert a mechanism to avoid a value to
be produced (and in the example, assigned) where none was intended.

The |voiding| expression type serves that purpose. It distinguishes itself
from instances of |conversion|, in that |voiding::evaluate| calls |evaluate|
for the contained expression with |l==no_value|, rather than with
|l==single_value| as |conversion::evaluate| does. If fact that is about all
that |voiding| is about.

@< Type definitions @>=
class voiding : public expression_base
{ expression_ptr exp;
public:
  voiding(expression_ptr e) : exp(e.release()) @+{}
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ The |voiding::evaluate| method should not ignore its own |level| argument
completely: when called with |l==single_value|, an actual empty tuple should
be produced on the stack, which |wrap_tuple<0>()| does.

@+{@; out << "voided:" << *exp; }


@ The function |coerce| simply traverses the |coerce_table| looking for an
appropriate entry, and wraps |e| into a corresponding |conversion| if it finds
one. Ownership of the expression pointed to by |e| is handled implicitly: it
is released during the construction of the |conversion|, and immediately
afterwards |reset| reclaims ownership of the pointer to that |conversion|.
Note that the |conversion| constructor uses |*it| only for its
|conversion_info| base type; the types |from| and |to| are not retained at run
time.

When |to_type==void_type|, the conversion always succeeds, as the syntactic
voiding coercion is allowed in all places where |coerce| is called. We used to
do |e.reset(new voiding(std::move(e)));| in that case as well, which is a safe
way to ensure that voiding will take place dynamically whenever present
syntactically. However as argued above, in most cases no runtime action is
necessary, since the context will have already set |l==no_value| for
subexpressions with void type. In removing that statement from the code below,
we have moved responsibility to type analysis, which must now ensure that any
subexpression with void type will have |l==no_value| when evaluated. This
means that in some cases a |voiding| has to be constructed explicitly. This
crops up in many places (for instance a component in a tuple display just
might happen to have void type), but almost all such cases are far-fetched; so
we trade some economy of code for efficiency in execution.

@< Function definitions @>=
bool coerce(const type_expr& from_type, const type_expr& to_type,
	    expression_ptr& e)

    @/{@; e.reset(new conversion(*it,std::move(e)));

  return false;
}

@ Often we first try to specialise a required type to the available type of a
subexpression, or else (if the first fails) coerce the available type to the
one required. The function |conform_types| will facilitate this. The argument
|d| is a possibly already partially converted expression, which should be
further wrapped in a conversion call if appropriate, while |e| is the original
expression that should be mentioned in an error message if both attempts fail.
A call to |conform_types| will be invariably followed (upon success) by
returning the expression now held in the argument~|d| from the calling
function; we can avoid having to repeat that argument in a return statement by
returning the value in question already from |conform_types|. To indicate that
the expression~|d| is incorporated into to return value, we choose to get |d|
passed by rvalue reference, even though the argument will usually be held in a
variable.

If both attempts to conform the types fail we throw a |type_error|; doing so
we must take a copy of |found| (since it a qualified |const|), but we can move
from |required|, whose owner will be destructed before the error is caught.

@ List displays and loops produce a row of values of arbitrary (but identical)
type; when they occur in a context requiring a non-row type, we may be able to
find a coercion that reconciles the requirements. The following function finds
whether this is possible, and if so sets |component_type| to the type required
for the components; if not it will return~|nullptr|. The implementation is
simply to look in |coerce_table| for conversions from some row type, then try
to specialise |component_type| to the component type of that row type. By
using this mechanism, the components of a row display themselves obtain a
context that may generate further conversions to obtain this type.

Currently all calls to this function have |component_type| initially
undetermined, so the call to of the |specialise| method will always succeed,
but we test the result nonetheless. In case there exist multiple row types
that could convert to |final_type|, the first one in the table is chosen; this
currently happens when |final_type| is \.{mat}, in which case this function
will return |component_type| equal to \.{vec} rather than to \.{[int]}.

@*1 Proximity of types.
%
The above implicit conversions of types pose a limitation to the possibilities
of overloading operator symbols and function identifiers. If a symbol should
be overloaded for too closely related operand types, situations could occur in
which given operand expressions can be converted to either one of the operand
types. This would either produce unpredictable behaviour, or necessitate a
complicated set of rules to determine which of the definitions of the symbol
is to be used (overloading resolution in \Cpp\ is a good example of such
complications).

There are two ways to avoid the occurrence of complications by restricting the
rules of the language: either forbid type conversions in arguments of
overloaded symbols, or forbid simultaneous definitions of such symbols for too
closely related types. Forbidding all automatic type conversions in case of
overloading would defeat to a large extent the purpose of overloading, namely
as a convenience to the user. Originally we therefore chose the latter
solution of allowing all coercions in arguments, while forbidding overloading
in certain cases. However this both had practical implementation problems (we
needed to try to convert operands with every possible operand type as required
type, which took too much time) and led to severe mutual exclusions between
overloaded types, as often some expression might be simultaneously acceptable
to two different types; as extreme case we needed do exclude \.{void} as
overloaded operand type altogether, since \emph{any} valid expression can be
voided to \.{void}. Therefore we settled for a mixture of both kinds of
restrictions, allowing only certain conversions in operand types and
forbidding overloading between types related by them. This is somewhat along
the model of the language Algol~68, where the ``firm'' context for operands
allows a subset of coercions. Our approach involves analysing operands twice:
first in isolation to determine their \foreign{a priori} type, and then
possibly a second time with a selected overload in the context of the required
operand type (if different from the \foreign{a priori} type), with the
occasion to insert coercions as needed.

Our rules for coercions and overloading will be governed by a single relation
|is_close| between pairs of (argument) types: its resulting value (a small
integer) will tell both whether for a given \foreign{a priori} type another
(operand) type provides a viable candidate, and whether two types can coexist
as operand types for a same overloaded operator or function. (Multiple
operands or arguments are considered as one argument with the tuple type
formed from their individual types.)

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
unsigned int is_close (const type_expr& x, const type_expr& y);

@ We do allow simultaneous overloading between closely related types in some
cases, namely if they can be ordered so that if $t_1$ precedes $t_2$ then some
expression of (\foreign{a priori}) type~$t_1$ can be converted to type~$t_2$
but no expression of type~$t_2$ can be converted to type~$t_1$; in such cases
reasonable behaviour can be obtained by trying a match for~$t_1$ before trying
one for~$t_2$, and this allows for instance arithmetic operators to be defined
for type \.{(int,int)} as well as for type \.{(rat,rat}). Note that the
conversion does not necessarily apply at the outer level, since the
expressions could be tuple or row displays, with coercions being applied to
individual component expressions; for instance there exists nested displays of
\foreign{a priori} type \.{([vec],[int])} that can be converted either to
type \.{([[int]],[rat])} or to \.{(mat,ratvec)} if the context so requires .
So our relation will be a partial order, and compatible with tuple and row
formation: $x_i\leq y_i$ for all~$i$ implies
$(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\leq(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ as well as $[x_1]\leq[y_1]$.

Therefore |is_close| returns a value composed of 3~bits: one indicating
whether the types are close at all, and two others for indicating the
conversion partial order in one direction or the other. Thus |is_close|
returns an integer rather than a boolean value, with the following
interpretations: |0x0| means the types are unrelated, |0x4| means the types
are mutually exclusive but neither can be converted to the other (as for
instance \.{(int,rat)} and \.{(rat,int)}), |0x5| means the types are close and
(only) the first can be converted to the second (example, \.{int}
and \.{rat}), |0x6| is the opposite relation, and |0x7| means both types can
be converted to each other (like \.{vec} and \.{[int]}, or any case of equal
types).

For types $t_1$ and~$t_2$ which do not admit a relative priority of one over
the other to be established, we shall disallow simultaneous overloading with
arguments types $t_1$ and~$t_2$ if any expression given as argument could be
converted to either of them. Deciding the existence of such an expression
would require study of all available language constructs, but the situation is
somewhat simplified by the fact that, for efficiency reasons, overloading
resolution is not done using the complete argument expression, but only using
its type. In fact matching will be done using calls to the very function
|is_close| we are discussing here, testing the bit for conversion towards the
required argument type; this provides us with an opportunity to adjust rules
for possible type conversions of arguments at the same time as defining the
exclusion rules.

Empty row displays, or more precisely arguments of type~\.{[*]}, pose a
difficulty: they would be valid in any context requiring a specific row type,
so if we stipulated that one may write \.{[]} to designate an empty row
operand of any row type, then |is_close| would have to consider all row types
close to each other (and therefore mutually exclusive for overloading). This
used to be the convention adopted, but it was found to be rather restrictive
in use, so the rules were changed to state that an un-cast expression \.{[]}
will not match overload instances of specific row types; it might match an
parameter of specified type \.{[*]} (we allow that as type specification for
function parameters), and such a parameter can \emph{only} take an empty
list corresponding argument (this is very limiting of course, but it allows
being explicit about which overloaded instance should be selected by an
argument \.{[]}, by defining an overload for \.{[*]} that explicitly calls
the one for say \.{[vec]}).

These considerations are not limited to empty lists (although it is the most
common case): whenever an expression has an \foreign{a priori} type
containing \.*, that expression will not select any overload with a concrete
type in its place (overloading does not perform type specialisation).


@ So here is the (recursive) definition of the relation |is_close|. Equal
types are always close, while undetermined types are not convertible to any
other type. A primitive type is in the relation |is_close| to another type
only if it is identical or if there is a direct conversion between the types,
as decided by~|coerce|. Two row types are in the relation |is_close| if their
component types are, and two tuple types are so if they have the same number
of component types, and if each pair of corresponding component types is
(recursively) in the relation |is_close|.

The above applies to the most significant of the three bits used in the result
of the function |is_close|. The two other bits indicate whether, by applying
conversions from~|coerce| to corresponding (nested) component types of row and
tuple types, one of the types can be converted to the other. If the |is_close|
relation is false all bits will be zero, but in the contrary case any of the 4
possible combinations of the remaining bits could be set.

The expression |dummy| may be prepended to by |coerce|, but is then abandoned
(and cleaned up).

@< Function definitions @>=
unsigned int is_close (const type_expr& x, const type_expr& y)
{ expression_ptr dummy(nullptr);

      // undetermined types do not specialise (or coerce), and are not close
  if (x==void_type or y==void_type)
    return 0x0; // |void| does not allow coercion for overload, and is not close

    return 0x0;
  if (xk==row_type)
    return is_close(*x.component_type(),*y.component_type());

    return 0x0; // non-aggregate types are only close if equal

  @/{@; ++it0; ++it1; }
  return it0.at_end() and it1.at_end() ? flags : 0x0;
}

@ For balancing we need a related but slightly different partial ordering on
types. The function |broader_eq| tells whether an expression of \foreign{a
priori} type |b| might also valid (with possible coercions inserted) in the
context of type~|a|; if so we call type |a| broader than~|b|.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
bool broader_eq (const type_expr& a, const type_expr& b);

@~The relation |greater_eq(a,b)| does not imply that values of type~|b| can be
converted to type~|a|; what is indicated is a possible conversion of
expressions might depend on the form of the expressions, and only be achieved
by coercions applied to more or less deeply nested subexpressions (for
instance a list display is required if $a$ is \.{[rat]} and |b| is \.{[int]}).
It is not the responsibility of |greater_eq| to decide whether this succeeds
or not (an error will be thrown later if it turns out to fail), but it defines
a partial ordering to guide which types are candidate types will be
considered.

Since these are types deduced for expressions rather than required type
patterns, \.* stands for tho most narrow rather than a very broad type, indeed
one for an expression like \.{die} that can never return a value, and the
type \.{[*]} is narrower than any other row type (the only value that an
expression with this type can return is an empty list). Nonetheless
``broader'' does not imply more possible values, and the type \.{void} is the
broadest of all since all values can be converted to it.

The implementation is by structural recursion, like |is_close|, but some
details are different. We do take |void_type| into consideration here, as well
as the (rare) type |unknown_type|. Since we want to define a partial ordering,
we must forbid one direction of all two-way coercions; since those always
involve exactly one primitive types, we do this by only allowing the
conversion in the direction of the primitive type. For the rest we just do the
recursion in the usual way with just one twist: function types can only be
comparable if they have equal argument types, but there might be a recursive
|broader_eq| relation between the result types (because a coercion might
``creep into'' the body of a lambda expression; this is not likely, but we can
cater for it here).

@< Function definitions @>=
bool broader_eq (const type_expr& a, const type_expr& b)
{
  if (a.raw_kind()==tabled and b.raw_kind()==tabled and a.type_nr()==b.type_nr())

  auto ak=a.kind(), bk=b.kind();

@* Error values.
%
Before we describe evaluation of expressions we must realise that evaluation
can cause runtime errors.

@< Includes needed in \.{axis-types.h} @>=
#include <stdexcept>
#include <sstream>

@ We use classes derived from |std::exception| and similar standard ones like
|std::runtime_error|, but we define our own local hierarchy, with
|atlas::interpreter::error_base| as base class. The main reason to do this is
to have a centralised error message to which exception handlers have write
access, so that it is possible to extend the error message and then re-throw
the same error object. The simplest way to allow this is to give public access
to that string member, so we make this a |struct| rather than a |class|.

However, since extending the error message is what is done most often, we
provide a templated method |append_mes| to write directly to the message inside
an error object. (An alternative would have been to derive |error_base| from
|std::ostringstream| rather than to contain a |message| member; however we feel
this goes somewhat against the inheritance philosophy, since an error
object \emph{is not} a string stream.) The templated implementation does mean
one cannot pass |std::endl| (an unresolved function overload) to the error
message, but then that is quite useless anyway, and less efficient than passing
|'\n'|. The method returns |void|, and it intended to be called from methods
called |operator<<| defined at the level of derived classes, and returning a
reference to |*this| of the derived type; the later is essential if one wants to
be able to extend the error message inside the |throw| expression itself, as
will be most convenient, since it ensures that this extension does not alter the
(static) type of the thrown expression.

@< Type definitions @>=

      o << x;
      message += o.str();
    }
  const char* what() const throw() @+{@; return message.c_str(); }
};

@ We classify errors into three classes: those due to inconsistency of our
(rather than the user's) program are classified |logic_error|, those arising
during the analysis of the user program are are classified |program_error|,
and those not caught by analysis but during evaluation are classified
|runtime_error|. The  first and last are similar to exceptions of the same
name in the |std| namespace, but they are not derived from those exception
classes.

#endif
  template<typename T> runtime_error& operator<< (const T& x)
  @+{@; append_mes(x); return *this; }
};

@ We derive from |program_error| an exception type |expr_error| that stores in
addition to the error message a reference to an expression to which the
message applies. Placing a reference in an error object may seem hazardous,
because the error might terminate the lifetime of the object referred to, but
in fact it is safe: all |expr| objects are constructed in dynamic memory
during parsing, and destructed at the disposal of the now translated
expression at the end of the main interpreter loop; all throwing of
|expr_error| (or derived types) happens after the parser has finished, and the
corresponding |catch| happens in the main loop before disposal of the
expression, so the reference certainly survives the lifetime of the
|expr_error| object.

The error type is declared a |struct|, so that the |catch| clause may access
the |offender| expression for use in an error message. At the point where this
error value is constructed (and thrown), we just provide a general error
message |s| for storage in the |program_error| base class, and the offending
expression. There is no need to override either of the virtual methods here.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct expr; // predeclare
struct expr_error : public program_error

  ~expr_error() throw() @+{}
#endif
  template<typename T> expr_error& operator<< (const T& x)
  @+{@; append_mes(x); return *this; }
};

@ We derive from |expr_error| an even more specific exception type
|type_error| that we shall throw when an expression fails to have the right
type. In addition to the offending subexpression it stores the
types that failed to match. For the latter, the error value owns the types
pointed to, so the caller should relinquish ownership of, or copy (in case it
did not own), the types passed when throwing the exception.

  template<typename T> type_error& operator<< (const T& x)
  @+{@; append_mes(x); return *this; }
};

@ For type balancing, we shall use controlled throwing and catching of errors
inside the type checker, which is facilitated by using a dedicated error type.
If balancing ultimately fails, this error will be thrown uncaught by the
balancing code, so |catch| blocks around type checking functions must be
prepared to report the types that are stored in the error value.

@< Type definitions @>=

  ~balance_error() throw() @+{}
#endif
  template<typename T> balance_error& operator<< (const T& x)
  @+{@; append_mes(x); return *this; }
};

@ Here is another special purpose error type, throwing of which does not
always signal an error. In fact it is meant to always be caught silently,
since its purpose is to implement a |break| statement that will allow
terminating the execution of loops other than through the regular termination
condition. During analysis we check that any use of |break| occurs within some
loop, and without being inside an intermediate $\lambda$-expression (which
would allow smuggling it out of the loop), so not catching a thrown
|loop_break| should never happen. Therefore we derive this type from
|logic_error|, so that should this ever happen, it will be reported as such.

  loop_break(int n)
  : logic_error("Uncaught break from loop"), depth(n) @+{}
#ifdef incompletecpp11

#endif
} ;


@ Similarly to the above, there is a |function_return| object that can be
thrown to implement a |return| expression. Again analysis will have ensured
that the object will always be caught, so this type as well will be derived
from |logic_error|.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct function_return : private logic_error
{ shared_value val;
  function_return(shared_value&& val)
  : logic_error("Uncaught return from function"), val(val) @+{}
#ifdef incompletecpp11

#endif
} ;


@* Enumeration of primitive types.
%
The precise list of primitive types is of minor importance for the design of
the evaluator, but they must be given so that the type |type_expr| is
complete. So we collect here the list of primitive type tags, to be completed
whenever one is added in a different compilation unit. Most of these
enumeration values are never directly used, but they must be present so that
the evaluator can be aware of the number of primitive types (via the final
enumeration value |nr_of_primitive_types|).

@< Other primitive type tags @>=
vector_type, matrix_type, rational_vector_type,
complex_lie_type_type , root_datum_type, inner_class_type, real_form_type,
Cartan_class_type, KGB_element_type, block_type,
module_parameter_type, split_integer_type, virtual_module_type, @[@]


@~The following list must match that of the previous module, for proper
functioning of I/O.
