@* Introduction.
%
The purpose of this program is to read the files binary written by the
\.{atlas} software for saving the results of computations of Kazhdan-Lusztig
polynomials, or produced from them by the \.{matrix-merge} and
\.{coef-merge} programs, and to give the use access to these results in a
human-readable form.

@< Constant definitions @>
@< Global variable definitions @>
@< Function declarations @>
@< Function definitions @>
@< Main program @>


@ We shall use a global variable to controls whether constructing the internal
data structures of this program will produce any output to |std::cout| or
|std::cerr|. Normally constructors should not bother writing output, but some
of the data structures considered here may take a lot of time to construct,
and it is informative for the user to know which one is taking the most time;
therefore this flag is set by default.

@< Global variable definitions @>=
bool verbose=true;


@ Let us begin with something elementary, reading a sequence of bytes from a
file into an integer. We will have to do this for various numbers of bytes at
once: 4~bytes for numbers that represent block elements or indices of
polynomials, 5~bytes for numbers that point in the sequence of polynomial
coefficients (which for split~$E_8$ has more than $1.3*10^{10}$ elements of up
to $4$ bytes each), and a number varying from~$1$ to~$4$ for those
coefficients themselves. To return the result, we need a type that can hold
more than 32~bits; it would seem that |unsigned long long int| is intended for
this purpose, so we shall use that.
@< Type definitions @>=

typedef unsigned long long int ullong; // sufficiently long unsigned type

@~To allow for maximal efficiency (since this function is going to be called
very often) we make the number of bytes a template parameter, and declare the
function inline, so that the compiler can roll out the dependence on~$n$
completely. It is then natural to make the template function recursive on its
template argument, and to provide an explicit specialisation for one byte to
terminate the recursion. Note that since we are using little-endian byte
order, recursion is in any case the easiest way to assure increasing left
shift amounts for each following byte.

This does mean that for reading polynomial coefficients, where the number of
bytes is determined at runtime, we need an additional function
|read_var_bytes| that dynamically selects one of finitely many instances of
the template function. We could limit ourselves to instances for up to~$4$
bytes, since no cases requiring more bytes are envisioned (and even the
$4$-byte case is only useful for historic reasons: while for split~$E_8$ in
fact three bytes suffice, this was only proved after completing the $4$-bytes
case without finding any large coefficients, and since none of the previous
$3$-byte runs had produced usable output, the $4$-byte file was for some time
the only one available; it even is as this text is being written). However, it
costs very little to include a few more cases, so we go up to the $8$ bytes
that (probably) exhaust the capacity of the |unsigned long long int| return
value.

@h <iostream>
@h <stdexcept>
@< Function definitions @>=
template <unsigned int n>
inline ullong read_bytes(std::istream& in)
{@;
  return static_cast<unsigned char>(in.get())+(read_bytes<@[n-1@]>(in)<<8);
}

template<>
inline ullong read_bytes<1>(std::istream& in)
{@;
  return static_cast<unsigned char>(in.get());
}

ullong read_var_bytes(unsigned int n,std::istream& in)
{ switch(n)
  { case 1: return read_bytes<1>(in);
    case 2: return read_bytes<2>(in);
    case 3: return read_bytes<3>(in);
    case 4: return read_bytes<4>(in);
    case 5: return read_bytes<5>(in);
    case 6: return read_bytes<6>(in);
    case 7: return read_bytes<7>(in);
    case 8: return read_bytes<8>(in);
    default: throw std::runtime_error("Illegal read_var_bytes");
  }
}

@ At one point we shall also have the occasion to write a number to a binary
file. This is always a $4$-byte number so we define just this special case,
using little-endian notation as always.

@< Function definitions @>=
void write_int(unsigned int n, std::ostream& out)
{ out.put(char(n&0xFF)); n>>=8;
@/out.put(char(n&0xFF)); n>>=8;
@/out.put(char(n&0xFF)); n>>=8;
@/out.put(char(n));
}


@* The coefficient file.
%
Now we come to the files with information about the Kazhdan-Lusztig
polynomials or other data needed to access them. In each case we shall define
a class that holds information read from the file, and in case of large files
also a reference to the file stream itself, so that it can look up information
requested when needed.

The simplest type of file is that for the coefficients, and we shall deal with
that first, even though the class was the last one to be defined since we
originally proceeded without using a class at all. The file has a very simple
format: it starts with a $4$-byte indication of the number~$n$ of polynomials
(we maybe unwisely decided that since split~$E_8$ has fewer that $2^{32}$
polynomials, we may assume that $n$ always fits in $4$-bytes), then a sequence
of $n+1$ indices of $5$~bytes each, which record where each of the
polynomials' coefficients start (relative to the start of the sequence of
coefficients), and finally a long sequence of those coefficients.

There is not very much information we need to store permanently about this
file. Apart from the reference to the file stream, we record the number of
polynomials, the size in bytes and the number of the coefficients, and the
offsets in the file where the index and coefficient parts start, respectively.
We also store a value |max_length| that limits the length of the polynomials
that we expect to find, since this is quite an effective way to detect file
corruption before it does too much harm. This value will be $32$ for
split~$E_8$, but we allow it to be set in the constructor for this class, so
that this value is not hard-wired into the program.

@h <fstream>
@< Type definitions @>=

typedef ullong KLIndex;
 // must be |long long| to avoid problems when multiplied

class polynomial_info
{ std::ifstream& file; // non-owned reference

  KLIndex n_pols;  // must be 64-bits, for computing |5*n_pols|
  unsigned int coef_size;
  ullong n_coef;
  std::streamoff index_begin, coefficients_begin;
@)
  const size_t max_length;
public:
  polynomial_info(std::ifstream& coefficient_file, size_t deg_limit);
@)
  KLIndex n_polynomials() const @+{@; return n_pols; }
  unsigned int coefficient_size() const @+{@; return coef_size; }
  ullong n_coefficients() const @+{@; return n_coef; }
@)
  std::vector<ullong> coefficients(KLIndex i) const;
};

@ In the constructor we can set some information in the initialisation
part, but not all because we are limited to setting them in the order
declared, and not perform any statements in between. So we just get |n_pols|
by reading the very first bytes of the file, and then storing the file offset
reached in |index_begin|; we also copy the degree limit given as argument
into~|max_length|; the degrees of polynomials encountered are expected to be
strictly smaller, and there length therefore weakly smaller, than this number.

The coefficient size is not actually stored explicitly in the file, but we can
use the fact that polynomial number~$1$ is always the constant~$1$ for which
exactly one coefficient is stored, and the length of the sequence of
coefficient for this polynomials is therefore equal to the coefficient size
(no coefficients are stored for the null polynomial number~$0$, so we cannot
used that one). The length of that sequence is the difference between index
number~$2$ and index number~$1$, and since the latter is equal to the length
of all preceding coefficients, which is~$0$, we can just read the $5$-bytes
obtained after skipping the $10$ (null) bytes of the first two indices.

@< Function definitions @>=

polynomial_info::polynomial_info
  (std::ifstream& coefficient_file, size_t deg_limit)
: file(coefficient_file), n_pols(read_bytes<4>(file))
, coef_size(), index_begin(file.tellg()), coefficients_begin()
, max_length(deg_limit)
{ file.seekg(10,std::ios_base::cur); // skip initial 2 indices
  coef_size=read_bytes<5>(file); // size of the |One|
  file.seekg(index_begin+5*n_pols,std::ios_base::beg);
  n_coef=read_bytes<5>(file)/coef_size;
  coefficients_begin=file.tellg();
}

@ The main accessor function is |coefficients| which extracts a sequence of
polynomial coefficients from the file. Their number is determined by the
difference between two indices, divided by the coefficient size. If this
number exceeds |max_length| we throw a |runtime_error| after indicating the
poly index and degree in question. Otherwise we position the file for reading
the coefficients, and read them. Afterwards we test if the file was large
enough to allow reading, which is particularly relevant in case we are so
impatient that we run \.{KLread} before the file is completely written (for
split~$E_8$ that can take as much as days, depending on the hardware used,
making the temptation to take a peek before the file is complete
considerable). If there was a problem reading the file we throw a
|runtime_error|, but we clear the error status of the file first so that the
user can try again with a more modest index.

@< Function definitions @>=
std::vector<ullong> polynomial_info::coefficients(KLIndex i) const
{ file.seekg(index_begin+5*i,std::ios_base::beg);
  ullong index=read_bytes<5>(file);
  ullong next_index=read_bytes<5>(file);
  size_t length=(next_index-index)/coef_size;
  if (length>max_length)
    {
      std::cerr << "Found degree " << length-1 @|
		<< ", for polynomial #" << i << ".\n";
      throw std::runtime_error("Degree exceeds limit given");
    }

  std::vector<ullong> result(length);
  file.seekg(coefficients_begin+index,std::ios_base::beg);

  for (size_t i=0; i<length; ++i)
    result[i]=read_var_bytes(coef_size,file);

  if (not file.good())
  @/{@;
      file.clear();
      throw std::runtime_error("Input error reading coefficients");
    }

  return result;
}

@* The block data.
%
Next we shall consider the file with block data. It is not much more
complicated than the one with polynomials, but we reconstruct from it some
tables that will be necessary for converting pairs of indices into the matrix
into ``primitive'' ones, and these will be stored together with the other data
in the |block_info| structure. The unique object of this structure will
eventually be stored inside another class, which will regularly need access to
its data and at the same time provides protection from outside access, which
is the reason that we shall allow public access to most data members of
|block_info|.

The information stored about a block comes in three groups: some global
information such as the block size and the rank, followed by a description of
the ``descent sets'' of all block elements (given as bitmaps indexed by simple
roots), and finally ``ascent tables'' for those elements, telling how they can
possibly be raised to another block element according to some simple root.


We start by introducing some types that will be used to store these data, and
other data derived from it. Block elements themselves will be stored as
|unsigned int| values, which seems largely sufficient. The descent sets will
be represented by values of type |RankFlags|, which is chosen somewhat large
with respect to our current computational capabilities: it allows the rank to
be up to~$32$. Combining these for all block elements we get a
|descent_set_vector|. For the ascent tables we need more space, since for each
block element and simple root we potentially need to store a block element. We
define an |ascent_table| as vectors of vectors, to be subscripted at the outer
level by the block element, and at the inner level by a simple root (this
gives more storage overhead than the opposite order of selection would, but
for primitivisation it is more convenient to fix an |ascent_vector| while
searching for a suitable simple root). The ascent tables implicitly define the
notion of (weakly) primitive elements for a given descent set, which are the
elements that cannot be raised for the roots in that set. For each descent set
we shall compute a |prim_list| containing those primitive elements, and
together these will be grouped into a~|prim_table|.

@h <bitset>
@< Type definitions @>=

typedef unsigned int BlockElt;
typedef std::bitset<32> RankFlags; // we can go up to rank 32
typedef std::vector<RankFlags> descent_set_vector; // indexed by block element
@)
typedef std::vector<BlockElt> ascent_vector;       // indexed by simple root
typedef std::vector<ascent_vector> ascent_table;   // indexed by block element
@)
typedef std::vector<BlockElt> prim_list;           // list of weak primitives
typedef std::vector<prim_list> prim_table;
 // effectively indexed by |RankFlags|

@ Here is the structure holding the information about a block as read from a
file. Since all the information is read in during construction we do not store
a reference to the file stream. After each major variable we give estimates of
memory consumption the represent for split~$E_8$, on a $32$-bit machine, based
on average of $15000$ (weakly) primitive elements per descent set. These
estimates show that memory consumption should not prohibit running this
program on such an architecture. (One could note that for the empty descent
set all block elements will be weakly primitive, and that this contribution of
$453060$ can throw some doubt on the estimate of the average which was in fact
roughly calculated after the fact from an average over the rows (rather than
descent sets) of the number of \emph{strongly} primitive elements; if needed
we could exclude the empty set from storage in |prim_table| at the cost of
some extra code.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct block_info
{
  unsigned int rank;
  size_t size;
  unsigned int max_length;
  std::vector<BlockElt> start_length;
   // size |max_length+2|; defines intervals for each length
@)
  descent_set_vector descent_set;     // $453060*4    =  1812240$ bytes:  2~MB

private:
  ascent_table ascents;               // $453060*8*4  = 14497920$ bytes: 13~MB
  prim_table primitives_list;         // $256*15000*4 = 15360000$ bytes: 14~MB
@)
public:
  block_info(std::ifstream& in); // constructor reads file
@)
  BlockElt primitivise(BlockElt x, const RankFlags d) const;
  const prim_list& prims_for_descents_of(BlockElt y);
private:
  bool is_primitive(BlockElt x, const RankFlags d) const;
  void compute_prim_table();
};

@ The table |ascents| will serve to implement the operation~|primitivise|. For
each pair of a block element~$x$ and a simple root~$s$, the table can give an
other element~$x'$ such that $x$ can be replaced by~$x'$ in the computation of
$P_{x,y}$ whenever $s$ is in the descent set of~$y$. For this to happen it is
necessary, but not sufficient, that $s$ is not in the descent set of~$x$; in
the cases where no replacement of~$x$ is possible for~$s$ (including those
where $s$ \emph{is} in the descent set of~$x$) a special value |noGoodAscent|
is indicated in the table. There is a third possibility, namely that $x$ is
not replaced by another element, but that one may conclude directly that
$P_{x,y}=0$ (this happens when the ascent is ``real non-parity''); in this
case another special value |UndefBlock| is stored in the table (a similarly
named value is used in the Atlas program; that program has no equivalent for
|noGoodAscent| however, since it can deduce this form other information, which
has however not been written to the file with block information). Since blocks
are not expected to come near to filling up all the possible values of the
|BlockElt| type, we reserve two values at the end of the range for these
special indicators. (Note that the \Cpp\ compiler understands that
|~BlockElt(0)| is not a call to a destructor, but a bitwise complement taken
of a cast to the (integral) type |BlockElt|; this cast is not strictly
necessary, but it makes clear that the complement is to be taken over the full
width of the integer.)

@< Constant definitions @>=

const BlockElt UndefBlock= ~BlockElt(0);
const BlockElt noGoodAscent= UndefBlock-1;

@ The method |primitivise| finds for a given block element~$x$ and the descent
set~$d$ of a block element~$y$ another element~$z$ such that
$P_{x,y}=P_{z,y}$ and which is (weakly) primitive for that descent set,
meaning that $ascent[z][s]=noGoodAscent$ for all $s\in{d}$. Alternatively it
may return |z==UndefBlock|, meaning that it has been established that
$P_{x,y}=0$ (in this case the precise entry in |ascent| that was found to be
|UndefBlock| is not revealed). The algorithm is straightforward: we repeatedly
apply the first good ascent that is found, or return |UndefBlock| whenever we
hit that. It is conceivable that it could be arranged to hit |UndefBlock|
through certain sequences of ascents but not via others, but to try to find
these sequences by backtracking would certainly not win time. On the other
hand it might be feasible to try do propagate any |UndefBlock| entries in the
table downward to entries that will lead to them, but this would be more
effective if the table were to be indexed directly by a descent set rather
than by a single simple root as we have preferred to do here, for reasons of
economy of memory.

@< Function definitions @>=
BlockElt block_info::primitivise(BlockElt x, const RankFlags d) const
{ start:
  const ascent_vector& ax=ascents[x];
  for (size_t s=0; s<rank; ++s)
    if (d[s] and ax[s]!=noGoodAscent)
    { if (ax[s]==UndefBlock) return UndefBlock;
      x=ax[s]; goto start; // this should raise x, now try another step
    }
  return x; // no raising possible, stop here
}

@ The auxiliary method |is_primitive| will be used is constructing the
elements of the |primitives_list| table. It returns the Boolean value that is
equivalent to |x==primitivise(x,d)|, but it computes this more efficiently in
the case where the result is~|false|.

@< Function definitions @>=

bool  block_info::is_primitive(BlockElt x, const RankFlags d) const
{
  const ascent_vector& ax=ascents[x];
  for (size_t s=0; s<ax.size(); ++s)
    if (d[s] and ax[s]!=noGoodAscent) return false;
  return true;
  // now |d[s]| implies |ascents[s]==noGoodAscent| for all simple roots |s|
}

@ The public method |prims_for_descents_of(y)| returns a reference to an
element of the |primitives_list| selected for the descent set of~|y|. In order
to not waste time at the construction of the |block_info| object for elements
that might never be used, we implement lazy construction: initially all
elements of |primitives_list| are empty vectors, and |prims_for_descents_of|
constructs the list if necessary; for this reason this is not a |const|
method.

We do not know beforehand how many elements will be generated in the
vector~|result|, but at the end we do not need any spare capacity, so we
reallocate the final vector to one of the precise capacity needed: we
copy-construct an anonymous duplicate (which will have no spare capacity)
of~|result|, and then swap its contents with |result| itself.

@< Function definitions @>=

const prim_list& block_info::prims_for_descents_of(BlockElt y)
{ RankFlags d=descent_set[y];
  unsigned long s=d.to_ulong();
  prim_list& result=primitives_list[s];
  if (result.empty())
  { for (BlockElt x=0; x<size; ++x)
      if (is_primitive(x,d)) result.push_back(x);
    prim_list(result).swap(result); // reallocate to fit snugly
  }
  return result;
}

@ The constructor for a block basically just reads all of the block file, and
places the information read into the proper variables. This function can
almost be considered as a specification of the block file format. Note that
only |max_length| values of length information are stored in the file,
recording the internal boundaries between intervals of block elements of equal
length; the initial bound~$0$ for the first interval and the final
bound~|size| of the final interval are provided here without reading anything
from the file.

@* The matrix file.
%
The final type of binary file interpreted by this program is the one
containing the matrix information. What it represents is quite simple: a huge
triangular matrix with $32$-bit integral coefficients, which will be
interpreted as indices of polynomials stored in the polynomial file. Several
methods are employed however to limit the size of the file, which makes this
file type the most complicated to handle; also because of the size, no attempt
is made to read in all information at once, just as was the case for the
polynomial coefficient file.

The file consists of a simple sequence of parts for each ``row'' of the matrix
(actually one should say column, since it is the second index~$y$ that is
fixed); each part mentions the row number~$y$ (as a check), then the number of
weakly primitive elements for this row (also as a check, and to facilitate
interpreting the rest of the row data), then a bitmap showing which of those
primitive elements~$x$ have non-zero Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial $P_{x,y}$ (in
this case we shall say $x$ is strongly primitive for~$y$), and finally a
sequence of indices of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for those strongly
primitive elements. The set of primitive elements for row~$y$ is easily
reconstructed from the block data alone: it is the initial part of the
|primitives_list| for |descent_set[y]| of those elements of length strictly
less than that of~$y$, followed as final element by~$y$ itself.

The bitmap allows extracting from this list the subset of strongly primitive
elements, but that depends more essentially on $y$ itself (rather than just on
|descent_set[y]|), so it is not practical to precompute the lists of strongly
primitive elements for all~$y$ at once, nor even to hold all the bitmaps in
memory; the program will read in the bitmap and extract the strongly primitive
elements only once a value of~$y$ is selected by the user. The vector holding
strongly primitive elements has the same data type as those holding weakly
primitive ones, but we provide a |typedef| for it to emphasise the intended
interpretation.

@< Type definitions @>=

typedef prim_list strong_prim_list;
 // strongly primitive elements for fixed |y|

@ Once a row~|y| is selected, we store the information for that row in the
|matrix_info| class, so that subsequent queries for the same row can be
handles rapidly. The main public method is |find_pol_nr|, which looks up the
index of $P_{x,y}$ and also tells the primitive value~$xx$ into which $x$ was
converted before looking up the index.

@ Before looking at the constructor, which has to scan the entire file to
locate the positions~|row_pos[y]| in the file for all~$y$, we look at the
method |set_y| that selects a row and prepares for reading from it. We start
by reading the number of weakly primitive elements for this row, which gives
the number of bits in the following bitmap. The interpretation of all bit
positions except the final one depends only on |descent_set[y]|, namely the
block element recorded at the corresponding position of the vector
|weak_prims| defined below. The final bit is always set and corresponds
to~|y|, which is probably not the next element of |weak_prims| (in
retrospective it would have been better to exclude this useless bit from the
matrix file, but it is not easy to change the format now). However, |y| is
always present in |weak_prims|, so we run no risk in interpreting the bitmap
on an initial part of |weak_prims| first, and then replacing the final element
by~|y|; just to be sure, we do check that the element replaced is the one we
expect it to be.

@ Extracting according to the bitmap is done straightforwardly by shifting all
bits successively in the hairline position (bit~$0$), and selecting a value
from |weak_prims| if the bit was set. There exist methods for traversing only
the set bits, but the relatively large effort needed to find out which bit was
found would not justify using them except for rather sparse bitmaps, which is
not what we expect here. Nevertheless we take some advantage of the
possibility of skipping the rest of a word when it no longer has any bits set,
which is why the inner loop below terminates when |chunk==0| rather than when
|j==32|.

@< Read $\lceil$... @>=
for (size_t i=0; i<n_prim; i+=32)

    unsigned int chunk=read_bytes<4>(matrix_file);

      if ((chunk&1)!=0) cur_strong_prims.push_back(weak_prims[i+j]);
  }

@ The final element that we pushed ought to be the first element in
|weak_prims| of the same length as~|y|. We can locate it quickly by doing
binary search for~|y| in the vector |max_length|, and then for the first block
element of the length of~|y| in |weak_prims|, in both cases without expecting
to find exactly the element specified. Since |y| might itself be the first
element of its length, we have to use |upper_bound| in the first search, and
|lower_bound| in the second one. If all is well, we replace the element found
by~|y|.

@h <cassert>
@h <algorithm>

@< Check value of final element pushed, and replace it by~$y$ @>=

  const BlockElt* i= // point after first block element of length of |y|

  assert(cur_strong_prims.back()==*first);
  cur_strong_prims.back()=y; // replace by |y|
}

@ The method |set_y| serves to facilitate the method |find_pol_nr| which looks
up the index of a polynomial in the matrix file. Since |set_y| leaves the read
pointer at the beginning of the sequence of such indices, all we need to do is
primitivise~|x| to~|xx|, look up~|xx| in |cur_strong_prims|, and either read
the index at the corresponding offset in the file, or return~|0| (the index of
the null polynomial) if |xx| was not found. In fact it is also possible that
|xx==UndefBlock|, in which case we can return~|0| immediately.

In the first argument of |matrix_file.seekg| below, it seems impossible that
|it-cur_strong_prims.begin()| could be interpreted as a negative number (it
would require that |cur_strong_prims| occupy more than half of the virtual
address space (on a $32$ bit machine), in which case almost certainly memory
would overflow elsewhere), but as a matter of principle we cast the pointer
difference to an unsigned type of the same size (|size_t|) to ensure that the
offset used is never widened to |std::streamoff| as a negative number.

@ The constructor for |matrix_info| stores the file reference (which will be
needed throughout the life of the object) and initialises the |block|
sub-object using the block file, and then uses one of two methods to compute
the positions |row_pos[y]| in the file for the parts corresponding to each
block element~|y|, depending on the final argument |new_format|. If this
argument is |false|, then the file format is apparently the original one, and
we have to go through the parts of the matrix file in a loop, which can take a
lot of time in case of large files with many parts, even just for visiting the
beginning of each part. Therefore a new file format is provided that adds
information to the end of the file that allows setting the values of
|row_pos[y]| without doing a separate |seekg| for every element~|y|.

  delete block_file; // success, we no longer need the block file
}

@ We first consider the original, laborious, way of setting the values
of~|row_pos[y]|. Since we shall need to know the length of the block
element~|y| parametrising the current row, we keep a variable~|l| recording
this, which is possibly updated for each new~|y|using the |length_start|
vector of the block. The first $4$~bytes of each part should give the row
number~|y|, but we allow a special exemption for |y==0|, so that the very
first bytes of a file can be used to store a format identification.

We perform a check at each row that we find the identification number we
expect. The following number is also predictable, and we had a test here that
the predicted value matched the actual value, which at the time was intended
to allow confidently overwriting the number later in a new matrix format by a
more direct indication of where to find the next row. That format did not turn
out to be efficient, since it still needed to seek to the beginning of each
row in order to locate these beginnings, which (rather than the computation
that is also needed in the old format) proved to be the main bottleneck. Now
that it has been established that the prediction is in fact correct, there is
not much point to doing it every time, in particular since this check requires
generating the list of weakly primitive elements which for high-rank cases
turned out to form a bottleneck in itself (and to require lots of memory that
was not necessarily going to be used otherwise). Therefore this check has now
been excluded by a preprocessor directive.

possibility without additional effort. when increasing~|l|, we have a nice

@ The matrix file contains, as first entry after the row number, the number of
weakly primitive elements for this row. This allows the \.{matrix-merge}
program to interpret the following bitmap without any knowledge about the
block. Here however we do have the block information at hand, and we can
compute the expected number of weakly primitive elements from it. This allows
us to do a consistency check.

Predicting the number of weakly primitive elements is easy: we just count
the elements in the appropriate |prim_list| selected from the table
|primitives_list|, of length strictly less than~|y| (which can be done by a
binary search for the first element of the same length as~|y|), and add~$1$
for the element~|y| itself, which is considered weakly primitive for its own
row.

@ When we need to advance to the next part of the matrix file, we need to skip
over the bitmap and then over as many tetra-bytes as there are bits set in the
bitmap. Adding up all those bits will as a side effect move past the bitmap,
so afterwards we just jump over the computed amount of tetra-bytes.

  @< Add to |n_strong_prim| all individual bits in the bitmap @>

  matrix_file.seekg(4*std::streamoff(n_strong_prim),std::ios_base::cur);
}


@ To find the offset to advance in a file past the part for row~|y|, we need
to find the number of set bits in its bitmap; since the bitmaps are quite
large, this is the point where the old format costs a lot of time. As basic
operation, we shall use a function~|add_bits| that returns the sum all the
bits in the word~|x| (sideways addition of bits), which is the number of its
set bits. Its argument type is |unsigned long int|, which we shall suppose is
the largest unsigned type that can be held in a single register, and on which
multiplication can be performed in hardware.

@< Function declarations @>=
unsigned int add_bits(unsigned long int x);

@~The following procedure is attributed by D.~E. Knuth to D.~B. Gillies and
J.~C.~P. Miller (pre-fascicle~1a to volume~4 of {\it The Art of Computer
Programming}, p.~11). The idea is to successively replace groups of 2, 4, and
8 bits by their sideways sum, and then to use a judicious multiplication and
extraction to add all the bytes (the multiplication and extraction could be
replaced by a reduction modulo~$255$, but we assume that multiplication is
faster than Euclidean division). This procedure works correctly whether an
|unsigned long int| has 32 or 64 bits (in fact it works for any multiple of
8~bits strictly less than~$2^8=256$, i.e., for which the sideways sum itself
can always be represented in 8~bits).

@< Function definitions @>=

unsigned int add_bits(unsigned long int x)
{ static const unsigned long int b0= ~(~0ul/3);
  // |0xAAAA|\dots ; flags odd bit positions
  static const unsigned long int b1= ~(~0ul/5);
  // |0xCCCC|\dots ; flags positions $\cong2,3 \pmod4$
  static const unsigned long int b2= ~(~0ul/17);
  // |0xF0F0|\dots ; flags positions $\cong4$--$7\pmod8$
  static const unsigned long int ones= ~0ul/255;
  // |0x0101|\dots ; flags the low bit of each octet
  static const unsigned int high_byte_shift=8*(sizeof(unsigned long int)-1);
@)
  x-=(x&b0)>>1;          // replace pairs of bits $10\to01$ and $11\to10$
  x=(x&~b1)+((x&b1)>>2);
   // sideways add 2 groups of pairs of bits to 4-tuples of bits
  x += x>>4;
   // the sums of octets (bytes) are now in lower 4-tuples of those octets
  return (x&~b2)*ones >> high_byte_shift;
   // add lower 4-tuples of bytes in high octet, and extract
}

@ We are now ready to rapidly add up the bits of the bitset. If our
architecture is $64$-bits (or more, who knows?), we wish to invoke |add_bits|
for that many bits at a time, but the bitmap size is rounded to a multiple of
$32$~bits. Therefore we start collecting as many groups as possible that fit
into an |unsigned long int|, and finish by collecting any remainder in
$32$-bit groups. For the first group we round down, for the second group up,
which implies that it might happen that we could have done the entire last
group with one more |unsigned long int| in the first group; the possible gain
in speed one could obtain by a different calculation vanishes however due to
the more tricky arithmetic that would be needed. By the way, one could remark
that we could have added up the bits by a per-byte look-up in a variant of the
function |read_bytes|, and the whole issue of efficiently summing of bits
would disappear; it was however much more fun to do it this way.

@< Add to |n_strong_prim| all individual bits in the bitmap @>=
{ static const unsigned int ulsize=sizeof(@[unsigned long int@]);
@)
  size_t count=n_prim/(8*ulsize);
  // number of |unsigned long int|s to read

  while (count-->0)
    n_strong_prim+=add_bits(read_bytes<ulsize>(matrix_file));

  count=(n_prim%(8*ulsize)+31)/32;
   // maybe some tetra-byte(s) left to read
  while (count-->0)
    n_strong_prim+=add_bits(read_bytes<4>(matrix_file));
}

@ After all that effort, the ways to set |row_pos[y]| using the new file
format is very simple and fast. The main point is that we can find the block of
information by positioning with respect to the end of the file rather than the
beginning. The values stored are |block_size()| in number, and each is
$4$~bytes long; the wider values |row_pos[y]| are obtained from them by
accumulation after multiplication by~$4$, since the whole matrix file is
written in $4$~byte units. We shall see below how these values were written
here; essentially, they were obtained by first scanning the file in the old
way.

@* The row progress file.
%
A new type of file recently added to the repertoire is the one on which the
progress in terms of polynomials for each row is recorded; it can be created
by applying the \.{matstat} program to the block and matrix files. The file
contains a sequence of $12$-byte records, one for each ``row'' of the matrix,
indexed by a |BlockElt y@;|. These records are composed of three $4$~byte
integers giving total numbers for this row of respectively strongly primitive
pairs, nonzero entries, and new distinct polynomials. Here we are only
interested in the third number, in order to be able to quickly find the first
occurrence of a given polynomial number.

@< Type definitions @>=

class progress_info
{
  std::vector<KLIndex> first_pol;
    // count distinct polynomials in rows before this one
public:
  progress_info(std::ifstream& progress_file);
@)
  BlockElt block_size() const @+{@; return first_pol.size()-1; }
  KLIndex first_new_in_row(BlockElt y) const // |y==block_size()| is allowed
  {@; return first_pol[y]; }
  BlockElt first_row_for_pol(KLIndex i) const;
   // $i={}$\# polynomials allowed
};

@ To construct the |progress_info| we scan the file contents in a
straightforward manner, and then close the file. We store cumulative numbers,
so that finding polynomial will be easier; note that there is one more element
stored than there are block elements.

@< Function definitions @>=

progress_info::progress_info(std::ifstream& file)
: first_pol()
{ file.seekg(0,std::ios_base::end); // measure |file|
  if (file.tellg()%12!=0)
    throw std::runtime_error("Row file size not a multiple of 12");
  BlockElt size= file.tellg()/12;
  first_pol.reserve(size+1); first_pol.push_back(0);
  file.seekg(0,std::ios_base::beg); // rewind
  for (BlockElt y=0; y<size; ++y)
  { file.seekg(8,std::ios_base::cur); // skip ahead
    first_pol.push_back(first_pol.back()+read_bytes<4>(file));
  }
  file.close();
}

@ Looking up the row a polynomial first occurs in is done by a simple binary
search for~|i| in the vector |first_pol|; we shall return the last index~|y|,
with |0<=y<block_size()|, such that |first_pol[y]<=i| (then |i| occurs for the
first time in row~|y|), or it throws an error if |first_pol[block_size()]<=i|
which indicates that|i| is too large to occur at all). This is achieved by
calling |std::upper_bound|, which returns the pointer value |&first_pol[y+1]|,
and subtracting the address |&first_pol[1]| from it. Note that the former
pointer value should be the address |&first_pol[block_size()]| of the final
entry of |first_pol| if |i| occurs first in the final row
(|y==block_size()-1|). We also allow |i| to be larger than any polynomial
index (notably we allow it to be the number of polynomial indices), in which
case we shall return the value |block_size()|; therefore the second argument
of |std::upper_bound| should be the pointer |&*first_pol.end()|, which is
returned from |std::upper_bound| will make |block_size()| the value returned
from |first_row_for_pol|. On the other hand we need not cater for the
nonexistent values less than~|0|, so the first argument can be
|&first_pol[1]|.

@< Function definitions @>=
BlockElt progress_info::first_row_for_pol(KLIndex i) const
{ const KLIndex* p=std::upper_bound(&first_pol[1],&*first_pol.end(),i);
  if (p==&*first_pol.end())
    throw std::runtime_error("Polynomial index out of range");
  return p-&first_pol[1];
}

@ To actually locate a polynomial by index, we can now proceed as follows. The
first version of the function |locate_KL_polynomial| takes a row number |y| as
parameter so that any row can be (linearly) searched for a given polynomial;
the second version of |locate_KL_polynomial| calls the first one with the
first row number for which the polynomial occurs, so this one should not throw
an error unless |i| is out of range. The case |i==0| is somewhat special. For
a specified row, the first version of |locate_KL_polynomial| will normally
return a column number where this row has a zero entry if it exists, since
|mi.find_pol_nr| can return (the index of) the null polynomial. However, even
if no zero entry is found in the lower triangular part of the given row, the
column of the first (null) entry above the diagonal will be returned if there
is any; in this case we ``manually'' set |mi.x_prim| equal to the value
returned, since the value left from the last call of |find_pol_nr| is not
relevant. This ``above-diagonal'' case this will apply in particular when the
second version is called with |i==0| (provided that |mi.block_size()>1|), as
it will compute |y==0|, and therefore return $(1,0)$: the zero polynomial is
always recorded as present in the topmost row, even though it is not actually
recorded in the matrix file.

  for (BlockElt x=0; x<=y; ++x)

  if (i==0 and y+1<mi.block_size())
    return mi.x_prim=y+1; // an entry 0 above the diagonal

@* The main program.
%
Finally we are going to wrap everything up in the main program. It proceeds in
a fairly simple manner, processing the optional flags first, then the other
program arguments, constructing a |polynomial_info| object in all cases and a
|matrix_info| object if the number of arguments indicates that a block and
matrix file are present. The calling sequence is (with square brackets
indicating optional parts)

Here the option \.{-q} means set |verbose=false|, and \.{-l} |degree_limit|
means set the limit of the degrees of the polynomials to |degree_limit| (all
polynomials are expected to be of degree strictly less, providing a check
for data integrity; the default value~$32$ is adapted to split~$E_8$).

object dynamically, because pointers to them will be held in the |matrix_info|
object. We first open both for reading, but if transformation is requested the
matrix file must be reopened for writing as well. Only in the case of errors
do we delete the pointers allocated here (which closes the files if
necessary).

@ The file format expected is determined by looking at the initial bytes of
the matrix file. We define a special magic value that indicates that the
format has been revised. While the update is in progress we write yet another
value to the file, so that file left after a crash in the midst of an update
is not mistaken for one in revised format.

@ The mechanism for requesting a transformation is voluntarily contrived,
since we want \.{KLread} to be a program that can be trusted not to modify any
files. Therefore to request the upgrade, the program itself must be renamed
(possibly via a symbolic link) to \.{KLwrite}.

}

@ To reopen the matrix file we just close and open again using the same file
name, which is now in |argv[-1]|. We do this reopening before starting to scan
the file in order to warn the user early if write permission for the file is
missing, but we will not actually write until the initial scan is complete.

@ If we come to this module, then we have successfully read all the parts of
the matrix file, and we have recorded all file positions |row_pos[y]| in~|mi|.
After checking that we are in fact at the end of the file, we write the
sequence of values that will allow the |row_pos[y]| to be reconstructed upon
later reading. At the end of a successful conversion, we replace the
|work_in_progress| indication by the |magic_code|.

@ Here is the outline of the main loop of the user interaction. We catch the
|runtime_error| values that could be thrown; if that happens we print the
message thrown, but then continue normally.

If no matrix information has been read, we just ask for a polynomial index,
otherwise we ask for a pair of block elements separated by punctuation or
white space; in this case we still allow an index to be entered directly by
preceding it by a hash mark. One may leave the program by giving \.{quit}
where an index in expected; for the case where block elements are expected the
decision is taken in a further module.

@ Reading in an index is simple. We give an error indication if the input is
non-numeric, or if the number is too great to select a polynomial.

@ This code has been made to a module so that it can be used twice. If we
reach end-of-file on input (if |std::cin| is a file, or if the user explicitly
signals this by typing \.{\^D}), then although our module name does not
mention it, this is the place where it should be detected, and we stop
immediately since there is not point to reading on after end-of-file is
reached. Otherwise we only stop if the next string on the input is |"quit"|,
as the module name says; any other text just gives an error message.

@< See if input was \.{quit}... @>=
{ if (std::cin.eof()) break;
  std::string s; std::cin.clear(); std::cin>>s;
  if (s=="quit") break;
  throw std::runtime_error("Non-numeric input");
}

@ Reading a row number is even simpler, but we should not forget to discard
the input character that led us into this case.
@< Read row number |y| from |std::cin| or throw a |runtime_error| @>=
{
  std::cin.get(); std::cin >> y;

  if (y>=mi->block_size())
    throw std::runtime_error("Row number too large");
}


@ When we read the block elements $x,y$, we make minimal tests for correct
input, then we primitivise $x$ and print the information found, taking case to
distinguish three reasons for finding a null polynomial: it could be that
$x>y$, or that primitivisation hit an |UndefBlock| value, or finally the final
look-up could simply return~|0|. As a feature not mentioned in the prompt, we
allow asking for a special conversion of~|x| that is explained below.

@< Read in parameters |x,y|... @>=

  int c; BlockElt x,y;
  while(ispunct(c=std::cin.peek()) or isspace(c)) std::cin.get();
  // skip spaces/punctuation
  std::cin >> x;
  if (not std::cin.good()) // non-numeric input
    @< See if input was \.{quit}; if so |break|,
       else throw a |runtime_error| @>
  @< Record whether the user wants |x| to be converted @>
@)
  while(ispunct(c=std::cin.peek()) or isspace(c)) std::cin.get();
  // skip spaces/punctuation
  std::cin >> y;
  if (not std::cin.good())
    throw std::runtime_error("Failure reading y");
@)
  @< Convert |x| from index to primitive element if so requested @>
  if (x>=mi->block_size())
    throw std::runtime_error("First parameter too large");
  if (y>=mi->block_size())
    throw std::runtime_error("Second parameter too large");
@)
  if (x>y)
    throw std::runtime_error
      ("Result null by triangularity."); // not really an error
@)
  i=mi->find_pol_nr(x,y);
@)
  if (mi->x_prim==UndefBlock) // then |primitivise| hit a real non-parity case
    throw std::runtime_error
      ("Result is null because raising the first argument " @|
          "reaches a real non-parity case."); // not really an error
  else
    std::cout << "P_{" << x << ',' << y << "}=P_{" << mi->x_prim << ',' << y @|
	      << "}=polynomial #" << i << ':' << std::endl;
}

@ It is convenient to be able to specify |x| implicitly by its position in the
list of weakly primitive elements for~|y|, in particular since it is in this
way that the program \.{matrix-merge} knows them (it does not have the block
information at hand to find the corresponding block element). The user can
request this interpretation by writing `\.\#' directly after the first index.

@< Record whether the user wants |x| to be converted @>=
bool convert=std::cin.peek()=='#';
if (convert) std::cin.get(); // skip the character if found

@~The conversion itself is performed only after |y| has been read; the method
|matrix_info::prim_nr| exits specifically for this.

@< Convert |x| from index to primitive element if so requested @>=
if (convert) x=mi->prim_nr(x,y);

@ This module mostly serves to present the polynomial in a nice format (people
expect polynomials to be ordered by decreasing exponents), which moreover can
be fed directly into the math mode of \TeX\ if desired.

@< Locate the coefficients of polynomial~|i|... @>=
